	<h2>The Civil War in Bluegrass Music</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>While I have an article that explores this topic in a more linear fashion (<a href="https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/gcjcwe/vol11/iss1/4/">link</a>), I felt it was worthwhile to show a list of all the bluegrass songs I found with Civil War themes.  I have sorted this list both alphabetically and by year; here, "year" refers to the year the song or text was recorded or received, when known.  Though this is usually the same year the album was recorded or released, it is different in a few cases.  For the purpose of my project, I am more interested in knowing the date the material was created rather than the date it was released or first published.  The only song needing further explanation in this regard is "Those Cruel Slavery Days" by The New Ballard's Branch Bogtrotters; the date here is noted as 1929 rather than the year of the recording and album, 1994, because it is a more complete recording than available elsewhere based on an oral tradition by the original Ballard's Branch Bogtrotters.</p></p>

<p>The intent of this project was to find original compositions about the Civil War in the bluegrass vernacular.  While some traditional songs have been included here (either as a point of interest or because I included the rest of the album), the primary focus is on original material.  Additionally, not all of these songs or artists are <i>strictly</i> bluegrass; some are folk, some are done by bands who primarily focus on country rock, etcetera.  Similarly, some of the songs below have only a line or two which reference the Civil War, while others are instrumental songs with titles either referencing the Civil War or associated with the Civil War.  In general, I'd rather lean towards being too wholistic rather than too exclusive.</p>

<p>Tony Trischka's 2021 experimental bluegrass album, <i>Shall We Hope</i>, is very interesting.  While the album is not always strictly bluegrass and features several songs that are pre-Civil War -- "On The Mississippi (Gambler's Song)" and "Carry Me Over The Sea" -- it features predominantly a northern or slave perspective.  Unfortunately, it was not released at the time of my paper's writing.  In <a href="https://americansongwriter.com/tony-trischka-channels-civil-war-era-in-shall-we-hope/">an interview with "American Songwriter"</a>, Trischka said:</p>

<p><blockquote><code><i>"I decided to write a song about a river boat gambler, which became 'On the Mississippi (Gambler's Song)' on the album. I had fun doing that, so I said, 'I'm going to write some more lyrics.'"</p>

<p>As Trischka continued writing, an overarching theme started to emerge. "['On the Mississippi'] was sort of placed in the mid-1800s. Then I wrote a song about the hijacking of a train during the Civil War, which is called 'The General' on the album. After those two songs, it started percolating in my mind, 'Okay, I could turn this into something,” Trischka says. "I continued to write songs [set] in that period.” Finally, he realized that he could tell many different stories of that era by using the Civil War as a through-line.</p>

<p>"I've always had a fascination with the Civil War—it really captures my imagination,” Trischka says. "So this whole thing came together as basically a Civil War-based story.” To that end, he did in-depth online research, seeking out stories that went well beyond the often-told ones about famous battles. He says he was careful to make his lyrics as historically accurate as possible.</i></code></p></blockquote>

<p>Some of Trischka's songs were not included here, either because they were not directly related to the Civil War or its causes, or because they are too far-removed from the bluegrass idiom.</p>

<h3>Andersonville (Leroy Pullins)</h3>
<blockquote>It was down in West Virginia in 1864<br>
We were losing all the bloody ground we'd won the day before<br>
I was fighting for freedom, and it seems I lost my own<br>
When a Rebel soldier told me "Buddy, Georgia's your next home"<br>
<br>
I've heard old soldiers talk of prison and the one that is the worst<br>
The Devil's Kitchen down in Dixie that the angels must have cursed<br>
Then I remembered what they told me as he marched me down the hill<br>
"God have mercy on that prisoner who winds up in Andersonville"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I'm on my way to Andersonville<br>
Against my wishes, against my will<br>
I'd rather die on the battlefield<br>
Than to go to Andersonville<br>
<br>
[spoken freely]<br>
<i>Andersonville's a prison with walls no man can climb<br>
The guard's carry long black whips to keep the Yankee boys in line<br>
Prisoners war lying thick as mud, and I've often heard it said<br>
That it's hard to really separate the living from the dead<br>
<br>
The only water a Yankee gets to drink is the sweat fom his brow<br>
The only answer is to escape, but the question remains, is "how"?<br>
You see, the price of freedom is a costly one which few can realize<br>
But if they's taking the trip I'se taking it'd cut 'em down to size</i><br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I got down on my knees and begged the Rebel'd hear my plea<br>
Take my life before I get there, or help me to get free<br>
But the soldier had his orders, and what he does is right<br>
I know too well I'll sleep in Hell in Andersonville tonight<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Andersonville, Andersonville, Andersonville, Andersonville<br>
In Andersonville</blockquote>

<h3>Andersonville (Nothin' Fancy)</h3>
<blockquote>In the spring of '61<br>
I kissed my mother goodbye<br>
And I put on a blue uniform<br>
And I fought for Lincoln's side<br>
<br>
Til I got caught by Johnny Reb<br>
In the woods near Chapel Hill<br>
And I wished to God he would have killed me then<br>
But he sent me to Andersonville<br>
<br>
My uniform is faded now<br>
There's no boots upon my feet<br>
And I'm pulling worms out of the mud<br>
There's nothing else here to eat<br>
<br>
The Rebs can't even feed their own<br>
There's now way that they can fill<br>
The bellies of them Yankees here<br>
Starving in Andersonville<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Some men are born to preach God's word<br>
Some men are born to kill<br>
I guess that I was only born<br>
To die in Andersonville<br>
<br>
I dug a hole with my bare hand<br>
In that red, hard Georgia clay<br>
Cause there's just no shelter from the sun<br>
Or the cold wind or the rain<br>
<br>
I'm too damn weak to stand up tall<br>
So I'll just lay quiet and still<br>
Lincoln burried me in this hole I dug<br>
When I died in Andersonville<br>
<br>
I dream the same dream ever night<br>
Of a woman I've never known<br>
She's standing by a warm fireside<br>
She whispers "I have come home"<br>
<br>
Every morning when I wake, I pray<br>
Some day that she will lay<br>
A flower on my graveside<br>
When I die in Andersonville<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Angel In Gray</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
I saw an angel in gray<br>
Jump a wall to where the dying lay<br>
On his back, no room for golden wings<br>
All he had was water-filled canteens<br>
Giving hope to the wounded that day<br>
I saw an angel in gray<br>
<br>
Fredericksburg, December '62<br>
Skies were gray and winter winds they blew<br>
Two armies poised for a fight<br>
Both believing that their cause was right<br>
Behind the stone wall, below the heights<br>
We know Johnny's waiting for a fight<br>
So we grab our guns and we fix our bayonnets<br>
Try to prepare for what we know is next<br>
<br>
We attacked wave after wave<br>
Charged the wave on the slopes that day<br>
Thousands called home to rest<br>
Hundreds more dying a slow death<br>
For hours the wounded lay<br>
Death or water, they all prayed<br>
No relief is on the way<br>
Because the snipers play their deadly game<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Only a boy of seventeen<br>
I've seen war and all the pain it brings<br>
Yeah, I've seen mercy from the enemy<br>
He knelt down and he shared a drink with me<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
And if I live a hundred years from today<br>
I can't forget the angel in gray<br>
I won't forget the angel in gray</blockquote>

<h3>Antietam</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/52/mode/2up?q=Appomattox"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
Antietam, a tribute to you<br>
<br>
As General Lee headed his mighty army to Antietam Creek, Maryland<br>
No one knew or even dreamed the dreadful day that was waiting for his command<br>
The Confederates caught the Federals resting, awaiting tomorrow's fight<br>
And the next moment the cannon's roar drowned out their screams of fright<br>
<br>
The dead were thicker than the cornstalks that grew on the Miller farm<br>
And you couldn't hardly walk at all unless it was on a back, chest, or arm<br>
The Louisiana and Georgia brigades, face to face in death row, stood<br>
And they had to give some of the cornfield away until reinforced by General Hood<br>
<br>
The men of the First Texas Regiment, while eight out of ten of them dying<br>
They made Meade's Pennsylvanian's pay hard for their pain and their suffering and crying<br>
Twelve thousand three hundred and fifty union men perished and thirteen thousand seven hundred Grays in one day's hours<br>
These dedicated lives were lost forever, their grave was only cornstalks for flowers<br>
<br>
Thus ended Lee's invasion north, what a terrible price he had to pay<br>
The Southern cause was jolted south, time it was to think and pray<br>
Antietam's battlefields are kept today in memory of those who had to die<br>
And as we think and look at you, Antietam, we can't help but wonder why<br>
<br>
Antietam, a tribute to you</blockquote>

<h3>Antietam 1862</h3>
<blockquote>And it's hardtack when I'm hungry<br>
There's no water when I'm dry<br>
And it does not make a difference<br>
If I live or die<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I will lay here with the wounded<br>
I will lay here with the dying<br>
As the sun bows out<br>
With a thousand goodbyes<br>
<br>
I unravel and there's bloodshed<br>
Bodies piled so high<br>
And I pray, but it does nothing<br>
Empty words cast at the sky<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Today I lay down in the open field<br>
Bullets pass me by and many men were killed<br>
I'm too sick to fight, I'm too tired to die<br>
If I live to see tomorrow, I doubt that I will rise<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I deserted at Antietam, I traveled fast and light<br>
The posse caught up with me and almost took my life<br>
They charged me with sedition, and beat me nearly blind<br>
They gave me back my rifle, put me back on the front line<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I miss my old Virginia, my dear old country home<br>
My wife is waiting for me and I can't leave her alone<br>
So when this war is over, I'll go back to my field<br>
I'll go back to my plow with a wound that doesn't heal<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Cause it's hardtack when I'm hungry<br>
There's no water when I'm dry<br>
And it does not make a difference<br>
If I live or die<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I unravel and there's bloodshed<br>
Bodies piled so high<br>
And I pray but it does nothing<br>
Empty words cast at the sky<br>
<br>

<h3>Appomattox (Lonesome Ride)</h3>
<blockquote>"Appomattox" - Gary G. Smith<br>
On April 9, 1865, the war for the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered at Appomattox Court House. Griffith Creasy and brother, Thomas, two of about 50 remaining soldiers of the 28th, didn't remain for a pardon from U. S. Troops. They, like many other confederate soldiers, didn't trust the pardon process, so the next day they took their guns and accouterments, walked away, and went home. In Griffith's and Thomas' case, home was just a few miles south of Bedford, (then Liberty), Virginia. The song relays the hardships of the final days of the war for Southern soldiers and Griffith's leaving to go home.<br>
<br>
This music is dedicated to my mother, Myrtle Creasy Smith, and to Lewis Griffith Creasy (2/10/1862 - 4/9/1865), John Hancel Creasy (4/27/1861 - 6/15/1865), Thomas Garrett Creasy (4/27/1861 - 4/9/ 1865), Co. G, 28th Virginia Infantry<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
Appomattox, Appomattox you'll go down in history<br>
Along with names like General Grant and Robert E. Lee<br>
Appomattox, Appomattox on April nine and ten<br>
In the town of Appomattox the war came to an end<br>
<br>
We've fought this war for four years now<br>
There's been some bloody fights<br>
But here we are in this old town<br>
To end it on this night<br>
<br>
We fought all the way from Richmond<br>
From White Oak to Sailor's Creek<br>
Our clothes were dirty tattered and torn<br>
We were hungry tired and weak<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
General Lee said we'd surrender<br>
That we'd fought our last fight<br>
That they would give us a pardon<br>
And food for the night<br>
<br>
But I don't want no pardon<br>
I ain't done nothing wrong<br>
I'll just take my gun and walk away<br>
And go back to my home<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
General Lee rode out to meet them<br>
The men all bowed their heads<br>
It was a sad and mournful day<br>
That we'd all come to dread<br>
<br>
This war we'd fought so hard to win<br>
Will now come to an end<br>
Hail to the men who fought and died<br>
Their freedom to defend<br>
<br>
Chorus</blockquote>

<h3>Appomattox (Reno &amp; Smile)</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/26/mode/2up?q=antietam"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
General Lee and his troops knew now the end of the war had come<br>
And General Grant felt surely now for their blood loss would help none<br>
<br>
Four years of bitter fighting with mind and heart and soul<br>
A cavalcade of heroes dead and dying in their role<br>
<br>
What thinks a man, I've often thought, as good as General Lee<br>
When his ragged comrades call to him, "Please let us die for thee"?<br>
<br>
Three hundred fifty nine thousand died wearing the northern blue<br>
Two hundred fifty eight thousand wore gray finally died too<br>
<br>
What did a general great as Lee think of or want to say?<br>
When tired troops stacked their battle flags and have to end the fray?<br>
<br>
He heard their cries of "no, no no," their faces wet with tears<br>
For him they would fight on and on, death for them had no fear<br>
<br>
Appomattox Courthouse stands today, a shrine where peace was signed<br>
Thank God for Generals Lee and Grant, both sides have peace of mind</blockquote>

<h3>Army of the Lord</h3>
<blockquote>This old war had finely made me see<br>
I'd been living on the edge of eternity<br>
I'd been drifting aimlessly til God got ahold of me<br>
And joined up in the army of the Lord<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Cause when I fought with just a gun and a sword<br>
I wasn't sure what I was fighting for<br>
But new orders have come down calling me to higher ground<br>
And now I'm in the army of the Lord<br>
<br>
Revival swept through the camp that day<br>
I saw many men like me change their way<br>
Nonbelievers saw the light and readied for the fight<br>
And joined in the army of the Lord<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Oh I know I've picked the right way<br>
And I don't believe it's the blue or gray<br>
Showing others wrong from right and teaching of God' might<br>
Training soldiers in the army of the Lord<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>At the Purchaser's Option</h3>
<blockquote>I've got a babe, but shall I keep him?<br>
'Twill come the day when I'll be weepin'<br>
But how can I love him any less?<br>
This little babe upon my breast<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
You can take my body<br>
You can take my bones<br>
You can take my blood<br>
But not my soul<br>
You can take my body<br>
You can take my bones<br>
You can take my blood<br>
But not my soul<br>
<br>
I've got a body, dark and strong<br>
I was young but not for long<br>
You took me to bed a little girl<br>
Left me in a woman's world<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Day by day, I work the line<br>
Every minute overtime<br>
Fingers nimble, fingers quick<br>
My fingers bleed to make you rich<br>
<br>
CHORUS (x2)<br>
<br>
I've got a babe, but shall I keep him?</blockquote>

<h3>Atlanta Is Burning</h3>
<blockquote>(<i>spoken intro accompanying some live performances</i>)<br>
The date of April 13th, 1865 partly closed the greatest strife this nation has ever endured. Four long and paintful years our country was divided in a great Civil War. In the spring of 1863 a young man from Georgia left his bride of just one week to wear the gray uniform of the Confederate States of America...<br>
<br>
Two (or three) years we've been fighting, though it seems like a hundred<br>
Away to the South is the home I once knew<br>
Where my loved ones are waiting, for word from the captain<br>
That the battle has ended for the gray and the blue<br>
<br>
I left dear old Georgia on the first day of April<br>
The grass in the valley was just turning green<br>
I married my Sally, just a week before leaving<br>
We now have a baby that I've never seen<br>
<br>
She sent me a letter, that told of our baby<br>
He's just like his daddy were the words that she said<br>
But that's been so long now, that it seems like forever<br>
And Lord I'm so homesick I wish I were dead<br>
<br>
Atlanta is burning, the horizon is flame<br>
The thunder of cannons in the distance I hear<br>
I think of my Sally, and the son that she gave me<br>
If I could just see her and the baby so dear<br>
<br>
A bullet has found me, and the darkness is falling<br>
The pain is unreal and my body's so weak<br>
The captain is calling, but I cannot answer<br>
My thoughts wander Southward as I go to sleep<br>
<br>
My thoughts wander Southward as I go to sleep.</blockquote>

<h3>Ballad of the 20th Maine</h3>
<blockquote>My name is Andrew Tozier, I'm a child of Litchfield, Maine<br>
And I left my only family for the sea, the salt, and rain<br>
And when Lincoln called the banners in 1861<br>
Well I joined the union army for the land that I am from<br>
<br>
We were baptized by fire in the battle of Bull Run<br>
And we fought our southern brothers in the wind, the snow, and sun<br>
And when our time was over I heard the governor say<br>
"Keep fighting for the union for just another day"<br>
So we joined the lion of Bowdoin, Chamberlain his name<br>
And we marched once more toward battle as the 20th of Maine<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
If we should die today, then dream a dream of heaven<br>
Take your northern hearts with you to the grave<br>
Be proud and true you are a union soldier<br>
Stand fast, ye are the boys of Maine<br>
<br>
Well, our western flank, it was missing<br>
As the confederates, they pushed on<br>
And I fought them tooth and nail<br>
Our ammunition all but gone<br>
And alone I stood with colors<br>
I was Flying proud and true<br>
For to let my northern brothers know<br>
The battle was not through<br>
<br>
And then appeared our lion, he was roaring bayonets<br>
Charging down the mountain with what forces we had left<br>
'Cause we're as steadfast as Katahdin<br>
We're as hard as winter's rain<br>
Go straight to hell with your rebel yell<br>
We are the boys of Maine<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>The Battle Of Atlanta</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/36/mode/2up?q=Atlanta"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
Forgotten men who lie asleep in a lonely soldiers' grave<br>
Who fought and die for the flag that waves across our land today<br>
<br>
Atlanta, "gate city of the South" was in the shank end of the Civil War fight<br>
Where William T. Sherman had a hundred thousand men backing up his might<br>
General J. E. Johnston's sixty thousand Confederates never had a chance to hit Sherman full force<br>
Exacted as he delayed and harried Sherman, hoping the price he'd paid would cancel Sherman's course<br>
<br>
After General Johnston's failure against Sherman, he was replaced by a hot-headed, one-armed and one-legged General Hood<br>
He attacked Sherman in the Battle of Peachtree Creek and there Sherman made Lee wonder if the plan was really any good<br>
Atlanta's dying city saw its dying men, row upon row, crowding its erupted, war-torn streets<br>
And the medical supplies were blockaded out and soon exhausted and the shelters were soon blasted down by the Federals' cannon beat<br>
<br>
Two Kessler Brothers coming from Germany; one went north and signed for the Union first<br>
The other went south trying to find him and was conscripted into the Confederates burst<br>
As the fighting progressed in and around Atlanta's geographical map<br>
One brother found the wounded other too late; tears fell as he died in his brother's lap<br>
<br>
During the month-long Atlanta siege, every house was hit, some a dozen times<br>
Broken homes were everywhere seen, and broken bodies steadily coming from the lines<br>
So many soldiers who fought in the Battle of Atlanta were just young, teenaged, reckless boys<br>
Atlanta, you must always remember this, for youth made most of the noise<br>
<br>
Sherman boldly then cut loose from his lines, circling far to the south of the city<br>
And General Hood's only rail line was smashed, his withdrawal from Atlanta was a pity<br>
With the end of each desperate charge, opposing youths were killed hand to hand<br>
While clasping each other in death's embrace, the blue and the gray died together, for Atlanta's land<br>
<br>
Forgotten men who lie asleep in a lonely soldiers' grave<br>
Who fought and die for the flag that waves across our land today</blockquote>

<h3>The Battle of Stone River</h3>
<blockquote>Sung by Oscar Parks. Recorded in Alton, Crawford, Co., Dec. 30, 1963, by P. Dunford and A. Rosenbaum.<br>
<br>
Doc Parks sang this vivid ballad for us a hundred and one years to the day after the Army of the Cumberland, under General William W. Rosecrans, and the Army of the Tennessee, under General Braxton Bragg, met to fight one of the fiercest battles of the Civil War in the cedar thickets along Stone River, near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Many Indiana men participated in the hard-won Union victory that cost both sides nearly 19,000 killed and wounded. Many Civil War songs tend toward the sentimental, as does the Ohio song about the same battle:<br>
<blockquote>Among the pines that overlook Stone River's rocky bed,<br>
Ohio mourns many a son that's numbered with the dead ... (EDDY, p. 127)</blockquote>
By contrast, the Union man who composed this ballad had no time for pious comment and concentrated on recording both the significant military movements and the feelings of a foot-soldier who had been through the bitter fight. The resulting piece, from the magnificent first verse to the sarcastic concluding one, has many of the qualities of the classic British ballads.<br>
<br>
The confederate generals referred to are William Hardee and John C. Breckenridge; the Union ones, Richard Johnson and Horatio P. Van Cleve. General Joshua
Sills was indeed killed leading a charge. We hope that no one is offended by Doc Parks' description of the man who claimed to have slain him, a rebel who was exceptional in the Kentucky hills, where sympathies were generally with the Union cause.<br>
<br>
For background, see Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, New York, 1956.<br>
See Parks earlier recording: AAFS 1727<br>
<br>
Last New Year's Day we had a fight, and on the day before<br>
And then we fought right straight along, for three or four days or more<br>
<br>
Old Bragg he called his men to line, and he told them they must hold<br>
Stone River and the country around, or else that they'd be sold<br>
<br>
Hardee was in the cedar swamp, that line just on the right<br>
Our general had his men in line all ready for the fight<br>
<br>
When General Johnson saw their force, he told them men to run<br>
He said that it was in vain to fight them rebels ten to one<br>
<br>
But when Rosecrans saw their scheme, he understood their plot<br>
And he reinforced General Van Cleves, and make them rebels hot<br>
<br>
I never will forget that day, the ground all stained with blood<br>
When hundreds of our gallant men lie weltering in the mud<br>
<br>
We fought them full five hours or more, them rebels would not yield<br>
Until our dead and wounded men lie piled upon the field<br>
They swore that they would not leave the field, and Breckenridge rolled in<br>
<br>
He took advantage of the night while everything was still<br>
And he bravely dashed into the fight, and there fell General Sills<br>
<br>
In wild confusion they left the ground, Stone River they plunged through<br>
And they never stopped to look around for Yankees as they flew<br>
<br>
I used to sing that--there's an old Col. Perry, right in that fight, and he shot old General Sills. And I used to sing that to him--he rode up un me one day, a-singin' it right out in the woods, and he made me sing it all to him... And when I'd sing it to him, he'd say "I'M THE VERY GODDAM MAN THAT SHOT HIM" and his neck-veins would get as big around as your fist--arm! Yeah, he'd say it just thataway, when I'd come over that part of it, "and there fell General Sills", he's say, "Yes, and I'm the very damn man that shot him," and those neck veins would just crawl up!</blockquote>

<h3>Battlefield Blues</h3>
<blockquote>This fast moving instrumental represents the emotions Civil War soldiers must have had following a hard fought battle. The tension set by a G minor tuning gives rise to the exhaustion and forlorn feelings, and loss of friends that the soldiers experienced. Even the high from victory could not erase the devastation of the battle. It is a tribute to great uncle John Creasy who served four years in the Confederate Army, April 27, 1861 to June 15, 1865. John played the banjo on many occasions in the camps when one was available. His talent has been passed through four generations and is demonstrated in this performance by Tom Smith, its author.</blockquote>

<h3>Big Round Top March / Drummer Boys</h3>
<blockquote>My prized possession was my drum; I loved it. Though I recall to this day the tired muscles after a long day's march over northern fields and southern miles, scorching sun, blinding storms, the drum growing heavier and heavier until it took all the grit a fella had not to let the others know just how near a body came to collapsing. Then, someone would shout "Lively, there, boys!" And then, the little fellas went at it with renewed vigor.<br>
<br>
We sons of Kerry in the drummers' brigade<br>
We hit the long road, every battle I pray<br>
<br>
I prayed for my father, was he lost in the war?<br>
I wondered if I'd see him once more<br>
<br>
We marched for days, shoeless and worn<br>
Drums at our shoulders, our uniforms torn<br>
<br>
Drummer boys, drummer boys, dreaming of glory<br>
Set the tempo for battle, I'll tell you a brave story<br>
Set the tempo for battle, I'll tell you a brave story<br>
<br>
The smell of the powder that June afternoon<br>
Our drumsticks blazing to the limerick tune<br>
<br>
[Vocalizing]<br>
<br>
My friend bore the flag, but to him death came<br>
He was cut down in a volley of flame<br>
<br>
I knelt by his side and I closed his white eyes<br>
I lifted his colors and I carried them high<br>
<br>
We rallied the troops, we strengthened their hearts<br>
As the bullets, they flew, each man did his part<br>
<br>
Drummer boys, drummer boys, through bodies new fallen<br>
Over cannon shot roar hear Gabriel calling<br>
Over cannon shot roar hear Gabriel calling<br>
<br>
Drummer boys, drummer boys, dreaming of glory<br>
Set the tempo for battle, I'll tell you a brave story<br>
Set the tempo for battle, I'll tell you a brave story</blockquote>

Who's gonna be the men?<br>
Who's gonna see that we<br>
Don't ever fight ourselves again?</blockquote>

<h3>Blue-Eyed Boston Boy</h3>
<blockquote>The song, "Blue-Eyed Boston Boy" taken from "The Last Fierce Charge," a Civil War era song, tells the story of a pact made by two fellow cavalrymen, one a young blue-eyed, blonde-haired boy, the other a tall, dark man. The pact was made just before their cavalry unit's last fierce charge of a well fortified Rebel position at the top of a hill. They each agreed to tell the others loved ones if one should fall. Both are killed in the battle so none was left to write to the tall man's sweetheart or the blue-eyed boy's mother. The song depicts clearly the Civil War soldier's deep-seated desire to inform love ones should they die in battle and the faith and trust they placed in each other.<br>
<br>
He was just a blue-eyed Boston Boy<br>
His friend a tall dark man<br>
The tall dark man was first to speak<br>
I fear this will be my end<br>
<br>
I have a face pinned to my breast<br>
Of a damsel oh so fair<br>
Write to her friend if I should fall<br>
Tell her I died up there<br>
<br>
There were tears in the eyes of the blue-eyed boy<br>
His voice was low with pain<br>
I'll do your bidding comrade mine<br>
If you will do the same<br>
<br>
I have a mother whose waiting at home<br>
To hear the news of me<br>
If you ride on and I should fall<br>
Write to her tenderly<br>
<br>
Just then the orders came to charge<br>
For a moment hand touched hand<br>
They answered "Aye" and on they rode<br>
That brave and devoted band<br>
<br>
They rode together to the top of the hill<br>
And the Rebels with shot and shell<br>
Tore furrows and gaps in the struggling ranks<br>
And cheered them as they fell<br>
<br>
There soon came a horrible dying sound<br>
From the heights they could not gain<br>
And those that death and doom did spare<br>
Rode quietly back again<br>
<br>
Among the dead at the top of the hill<br>
Lay the boy with the yellow hair<br>
And the tall dark man who rode by his side<br>
Lay dying by him there<br>
<br>
There was no one to write to the blue-eyed girl<br>
The words her lover had said<br>
And a mother awaiting the news of her boy<br>
Will only find he's dead<br>

<h3>Brotherly Love</h3>
<blockquote>During the Civil War, many families were divided on the issues that led to the Civil War. Although not confined to areas of Border States, many of these differences of opinion between brothers, fathers and sons sprang from border states that created boundaries dividing North and South. Several cases were reported where brothers who met on one of the battlefields visited with each other during a lull in the fighting. The song "Brotherly Love" shares a story of a divided family and develops the concept of two brothers, one Union, the other Confederate, meeting on a battlefield. It relates the emotions of brotherly love following the death of one brother unintentionally killed by the other.<br>
<br>
When shells fell on Fort Sumpter that dreary April day<br>
Many families were divided between the Blue and Gray<br>
Mine was such a family who lived along that line<br>
That divided North and South in everybody's mind<br>
<br>
My father and my brother chose the union way<br>
But I had different feelings so I dressed in Rebel Gray<br>
Each time we fought a battle and I fired my gun<br>
I wondered if I'd hit my Pa or his other son<br>
(Place of optional verse if used) see bottom of page<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
Brotherly love will break your heart<br>
When a Civil War tears a family apart<br>
If you kill your brother, you will surely pay<br>
For your memories will haunt you the rest of your days<br>
<br>
In that awful bloody battle of eighteen sixty-two<br>
We were firing cross a cornfield at the men in blue<br>
As we charged into the Yankees, someone called my name<br>
I looked and found my brother who fell among the slain<br>
<br>
I sat there with his head cradled in my arms<br>
I told Joe that I loved him and meant to do no harm<br>
The fighting raged around us though I could take no part<br>
For I had sent a bullet into my brother's heart<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Yes my memories will haunt me the rest of my days<br>
<br>
Optional verse (not sung on tape)<br>
You see, I still respected and loved them in my heart<br>
And it hurt me awful bad to see us torn apart<br>
But I did what I did and what I thought was right<br>
Still I worry that I'll shoot them each time we have a fight.</blockquote>

<h3>Burning Georgia Down</h3>
<blockquote>The Yankee letter said that they’d be comin’ any day<br>
And if you planned on getting out alive we’d best be on our way<br>
Our tattered gray was torn between if we should run or fight<br>
But our Southern pride swelled up inside as we dug in for the night<br>
Then I heard a rider callin’, they’re coming down the road<br>
And the fiery flash of twenty pounders started to explode<br>
We tried our best to stop them but our efforts were in vain<br>
In the distance you could hear the sound of Dixie’s last refrain<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
They’re burnin’ Georgia down<br>
Those devils dressed in blue<br>
They took the higher ground<br>
Dying’s all we can do<br>
Atlanta's bound to fall<br>
Smell the smoke and the cinder<br>
They're burnin’ Georgia down<br>
But we never will surrender<br>
<br>
Sherman left Atlanta leading sixty thousand of his best<br>
Spreading the destruction over 50 miles abreast<br>
Marching to the sea, leaving nothing in their path<br>
Factory farms and churches, nothing spared their wrath<br>
Ah, Christmas day in ‘64, they cut off all supplies<br>
And then they offered Mr. Lincoln up Savannah has a prize<br>
And though our lives are broken, we fought on ‘til the end<br>
And pray someday we’ll find some way to Dixie once again<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Butler Brothers</h3>
<blockquote>The Butler Brothers grew up on the Loudon County line<br>
As winds of war blowing through the north Virginia pine<br>
Reuben was the baby, Zach was the eldest son<br>
Those boys became men too soon in 1861<br>
<br>
One foot on Yankee soil, one foot on rebel ground<br>
Soon Virginia split in two just like the north and south<br>
Zach fought with George McClellan, Reubeb with Longstreet<br>
And left their momma fighting anxious teardrops on her cheeks<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
With one hand on the Bible and both knees on the floor<br>
She begs and pleads with Heaven to end this bloody war<br>
Surely God's heart breaks in two when He hears her praying<br>
"Stop the guns that called my sons away"<br>
<br>
Once a week they posted on the county courthouse door<br>
The names of all the soldiers killed the week before<br>
She always double checked it for names she might have missed<br>
And wept each time she couldn't find a Butler on the list<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Brother against brother, they marched to different drums<br>
Til they covered Williamsburg one spring in Butler blood<br>
Reuben went home dressed in gray, Zach in Union blue<br>
And left their momma wearing black in 1862<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Can You Run</h3>
<blockquote>There's smoke down by the river<br>
Hear the cannon and the drum<br>
I've got one thing to ask you honey<br>
Can you run?<br>
<br>
You know I hate to ask so late<br>
But the moment's finally come<br>
And there won't be time to change your mind<br>
Can you run?<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Can you run, to the freedom line of the Lincoln soldiers?<br>
Where the contraband can be a man<br>
With a musket on his shoulder<br>
I've got to stand up tall before I'm done<br>
Wrap these hands of mine around a gun<br>
And chase the taste of bondage from my tongue<br>
Can you run?<br>
Can you run?<br>
<br>
I'm taking nothing with me<br>
We've just got time to beat the sun<br>
And the boys in gray are never far away<br>
Can you run?<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
There's smoke down by the river<br>
Hear the cannon and the drum<br>
And even if I die, I've got to try<br>
Can you run?<br>
<br>

<h3>Carrie's Graveyard Book</h3>
<blockquote>“Unaffrighted by the sight of blood, unawed by horrid wounds, unblanched by ghastly death, [Carrie] walked from room to room, from man to man, her very skirts stained in blood.” – Colonel W. D. Gale, in a letter to his wife.<br>
<br>
The soldiers who fought in the Battle of Franklin in 1864 may have been far from home, but it took place right on Carrie McGavock’s doorstep. Her home plantation, Carnton, was commandeered as a field hospital, where she first treated the wounded, and after the battle, the dead. More than a thousand soldiers needed to be buried, and Carrie took it upon herself to make sure each boy rested peacefully in her graveyard. Until her death in 1905, she spent her time and fortune burying and recording each name in her graveyard book so that every family could know the fate of their husband, son, or brother.<br>
<br>
With the loss of three children down in Franklin, Tennessee<br>
Carrie McGavock was no stranger to tragedy and grief<br>
So with rows of wounded soldiers lying on her blood-stained floor<br>
She nursed them by the hundreds back in 1864<br>
<br>
Five hours the battle ended, but for Carrie it lived on<br>
Many long years after, the winds of war grew calm<br>
And on the field of battle, bones in danger of the plow<br>
Moved to Carrie's graveyard, they rest peacefully now<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
In that two acre graveyard, over fourteen hundred lay<br>
And to honor every soldier, Carrie kept a list of names<br>
So they wouldn't be forgotten, like so many others would<br>
And now they live forever in Carrie's graveyard book<br>
<br>
From all across the southland, for years the letters came<br>
From mothers, wives and fathers, searching for a loved-one's name<br>
When that name was written with honor on a page<br>
They'd come by horse and wagon to mourn upon his grave<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Carry Me Back</h3>
<blockquote>Well, I come from the valley, I'm a rebel boy<br>
Born on the banks of the Shenandoah<br>
In '61, I went to the war to win one for Virginia<br>
Yeah, my brother went first and they called me too<br>
I was green as clover in the morning dew<br>
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune<br>
Carry me back to Virginia!<br>
<br>
Fire in the cannon, water in the well<br>
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell<br>
I learned right quick how to march like hell<br>
And affix that bayonet<br>
<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Carry me back to Virginia<br>
<br>
With a sword and a saddle, powder in the gun<br>
We thought for a minute our fight was done<br>
So they lined us up with our medals on<br>
And hammered us into the quicksand<br>
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire<br>
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron<br>
Til the men took cover where the horses piled<br>
Then we shivered in the cold against them<br>
<br>
But the war raged on like flames of hell<br>
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell<br>
Dressed in rags and we ate like rats<br>
When they cut off our legs we cried!<br>
<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Carry me back to Virginia<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Carry me back to Virginia<br>
<br>
And they died in the valley, died in the swamp<br>
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped<br>
Died in the ditches, died in the fields<br>
In the belly of a wagon 'fore our wounds were healed<br>
Died in the war, starved in the camps<br>
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man<br>
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend<br>
And they buried us all over Dixieland<br>
<br>
Down in Alabama, down in Caroline<br>
Way down in Georgia, on the Tennessee line<br>
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee<br>
Now we want to go home to Virginia<br>
Say we want to go home to Virginia!<br>
<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Carry me back to Virginia<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
Won't ya carry me back?<br>
I wanna be buried in Virginia</blockquote>

<h3>Centreville</h3>
<blockquote>I left my friends who wear the gray<br>
Along a rocky run<br>
To see my darling Juliette<br>
The only girl I love<br>
<br>
Tomorrow I must leave her<br>
The blue-clad foe to fight<br>
But my darling sleeps within my arms<br>
In Centreville tonight<br>
<br>
The seven days, the seven pines<br>
The seven deadly sins<br>
Have got the best of this poor boy<br>
As from the battle I ran<br>
<br>
Three days and then I saw the lights<br>
Along the war turnpike(?)<br>
But the flag of the foe from the North now flies<br>
In Centreville tonight<br>
<br>
I made my way up to her door<br>
My spirit overflowed<br>
But the sight I saw through her window<br>
It made my blood run cold<br>
<br>
I saw a soldier dressed in blue<br>
My darling on his knee<br>
My bullet finished both of them<br>
His saber finished me<br>
<br>
A few more feet for me to crawl<br>
As the world fades from my south?<br>
And my darling sleeps within my arms<br>
In Centreville tonight</blockquote>

<h3>The Cedar Forest</h3>
<blockquote>When I saw the first wave coming I loaded and primed my gun<br>
When I saw the next wave coming I took to my heels and run<br>
I run clear up in the Blue Ridge Mountains and down the other side<br>
I run til I come to the cedar forest, there I found my bride<br>
<br>
She lived at the edge of the cedar forest, working her father's land<br>
She said he'd gone to be in the war and died in a foolish stand<br>
She didn't much care for my suit of blue and I told her I felt the same<br>
We dug a hole in the cedar forest and buried it with my name<br>
<br>
Well, we worked the land and dreamed our dreams and bore ourselves a son<br>
And three years passed before we heard that foolish war was done<br>
But wars are sometimes hard to end and in a month or two<br>
Six men rode out of the cedar forest dressed in ragged blue<br>
<br>
And at their head was Sergeant Crumb, the man who'd taught me fear<br>
He laughed when he saw me with my gun and said, "Now lads, look here<br>
We've found ourselves a cowards' nest, I watched him run away<br>
So we shall have his food and drink and his woman here today"<br>
<br>
Well they were six and I was one but I was hard to kill<br>
I drove them back in the cedar forest, I guess they're running still<br>
Now a man who turns and runs away from a politicians' war<br>
Might fight and die for what he loves though hell be at the door</blockquote>

<h3>Christmas Cheer (This Weary Year)</h3>
<blockquote>Just this one night, let's step back to celebrate and pray<br>
May the cannons cease and peace abide to honor Christmas Day<br>
Let us still our guns and dry our tears, friends and foe alike<br>
Brother must love brother evermore this Christmas night<br>
<br>
Looking 'cross the fortress grounds, sun through thinning cloud<br>
One smithy's shop shop and bake house door to greet the piney boughs<br>
Some play winter football while waiting for the dinner<br>
It's been a hard, cold Autumn and we're looking all the thinner<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Christmas cheer this weary year<br>
Not like the last, you know<br>
But hopefully by the next we'll be<br>
United with our families back home<br>
<br>
Sergeant Kant, for recreation, scrambles up a pole<br>
We greased it well, he slides right down, his comrades laugh and roar<br>
Roasted goose and oysters and a soup of greens and hock<br>
All simmered down with beef bone and a thimble full of 'nog<br>
<br>
Now hear the guns within the forts saluting old Saint Nick<br>
Who's just arrived through triumph's arch, he'll do just the trick<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Fading light of winter, Major Bartlett finds a stocking<br>
A meerschaum pipe awaiting him and pretzels, interlocking<br>
Young Collin, our drummer boy, opens up his gift<br>
A jack in the box jumps right up, we watch his spirits lift<br>
<br>
As Santa comes, so he must leave for Richmond and the west<br>
"G'lang" he cries and off he speeds, his sleigh with vested dress<br>
His absence leaves an empty space a song could never fill<br>
A battle looms, the war resumes, we face the evening chills<br>
<br>

<h3>Christmas In Savannah</h3>
<blockquote>“I beg to present you as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah.” -General William T. Sherman, in a telegram sent to President Lincoln on Christmas Day 1864<br>
<br>
The capture of Savannah on Christmas Day 1864 marks the completion of Sherman’s March to the Sea and the tipping point of the war in the Union’s favor. Savannah was occupied on December 20th, and though he flooded the rice fields around the city, Sherman largely spared the city itself. None of the mansions were harmed, and the churches were allowed to stay open. In areas where food was scarce, the troops put together carts loaded with Christmas dinner and delivered food pulled by mules dressed as reindeer. Despite the war and occupation, Christmas still came to Savannah.<br>
<br>
Christmas in Savannah is candy to the eyes<br>
Steeped in rich traditions of Savannah's southern life<br>
They celebrate with Santa and a festival with lights<br>
Rolling down the river, singing Silent Night<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Christmas in Savannah, 1864<br>
Came with no holly, no wreaths upon the door<br>
Christmas in Savannah came in the worst of times<br>
'Cause Santa couldn't make it through General Sherman's line<br>
<br>
Savannah fell to Sherman as that year drew to an end<br>
And a victory letter from General Sherman's pen<br>
Was sent with pride to Lincoln as a Christmas gift<br>
While people in Savannah had to make the best of it<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
There were no Christmas carols heard in that war-town town<br>
Til ninety Yankee soldiers from Michigan came 'round<br>
With food and fresh provisions in wagons that were pulled<br>
By little Christmas reindeer that looked a lot like mules<br>
<br>
CHORUS [ends: Til ninety Yankee Santas brought cheer from Sherman's line (x2)]</blockquote>

<h3>Civil War</h3>
<blockquote>Well, that old stone house is standing in the middle of the dell<br>

Yes, my family split in two by that Mason-Dixon Line<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Well we stormed the hill at Potter's Point like lightning from the skies<br>
And I shot my brother dead before I ever saw his eyes<br>
And I swore right then and there, never to again<br>
And I swore right then and there, never to again<br>
Well I walked a thousand miles and my boots are showing skin<br>
If I walk a thousand more I'll never kill again<br>
And you can call me what you want, but a coward's what I am<br>
You can call me what you want, but a coward's what I am<br>

Well my brother took the north road and I stayed at home with pa<br>
Yes, my brother took the north road and I stayed at home with pa<br>

Well, the day my brother died, I quit the revolution<br>
Yes, the day my brother died, I dropped my guns and ran<br>

<h3>Civil War Diary</h3>
<blockquote>It was cold and wet the morning we left for Atlanta<br>
We marched twenty five miles in the rain<br>
Walking on muddy roads, crossing flooded creeks<br>
Bridges burned out by rebel boys<br>
<br>
Sent for men in horses to get more supplies<br>
It's been sixth months since we've been paid<br>
I've had a fever and a chill five weeks now<br>
Haven't eaten in at least a couple days<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Can't wait to see the old home<br>
Is it still the way that I left it<br>
Don' you cry, I'll be coming home soon<br>
And we'll get married in the spring<br>
<br>
We captured thirty rebels, they were hungry and cold<br>
Most of them were only boys<br>
Just turned twenty a few months ago<br>
Spent my birthday in a camp near Bowling Green<br>
<br>
Fought Rebels near Selma, more in Montgomery<br>
They were outnumbered, their supplies very low<br>
Looks like the end is coming pretty soon<br>
Those Southern boys won't quit without a fight<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I hope I'll be coming home soon</blockquote>

<h3>Cold Harbor</h3>
<blockquote>(via <a href="https://bellbucklerecordsmusic.com/track/3375308/cold-harbor">Bell Buckle Records</a>) Singer and songwriter Daniel Crabtree released a new exclusive song, "Cold Harbor." Daniel has written a powerful song based on a true story of one of the most deadly battles in the American Civil war... <!-- // The track is a team effort; it was produced by engineer and famous banjo player Scott Vestal, along with respected instrumentalist Cody Kilby and veteran songwriter Daniel Crabtree at the Digital Underground Studio. // -->"In the song, I tried to imagine some semblance of what it must have been like. The final victory was won by Lee's army during the war. The Union army lost ten to thirteen thousand men over twelve days. I penned these words to commemorate the battle and the lives lost during our history. Let us not forget the price that's been paid so that we might live as one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<br>
<br>
Mechanicsville, Virginia, summer 1864<br>
Two weeks of horror in the heart of a civil war<br>
Union took the crossroads, Rebels all dug in<br>
Gunfire raging like sheets ripping in the wind<br>
Like sheets ripping in the wind<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Cold Harbor<br>
Thirteen days of hell<br>
A dark part of history<br>
And history knows it well<br>
<br>
Wrote my name down and pinned it to my chest<br>
Took my blood stained diary, held close to my breast<br>
Pinned my last entry there on the battlefield<br>
This day on June 3rd at Cold Harbor I was killed<br>
Today at Cold Harbor I was killed<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Grant gave the orders, really had no plan<br>
Troops slaughtered as we followed his command<br>
My boots red as crimson, blood flowing on the ground<br>
It was there at Cold Harbor, that day they shot me down<br>
That day the Rebels shot me down<br>

<h3>Company of Cowards</h3>
<blockquote>As I was walkin' down the road, 'twas on one summer's day<br>
What d'you suppose I chanced to see, goin' the other way?<br>
Well I knew it weren't the Navy nor the whole McDougal clan<br>
'Twas a company of cowards, I could tell by the way they ran<br>
<br>
Oh get around oh get around get around<br>
Oh get around get away<br>
'Tis a company of cowards<br>
And they've come to save the day<br>
<br>
You should've seen their uniforms, shabby as you please<br>
Mighty shy of buttons, rather baggy at the knees<br>
And such was their appearance, we laughed until we cried<br>
It's a pity, Mr. Lincoln, they're not on the other side<br>
Oh get around oh get around get around<br>
Oh get around get away<br>
'Tis a company of cowards<br>
And they've come to save the day<br>
<br>
I don't recall I ever heard that bugle sound retreat<br>
I could only hear the thunder of a hundred scamperin' feet<br>
It was forward into battle they came marching one by one<br>
But I guess they thought it over, and they thought it best to run<br>
<br>
Oh get around oh get around get around<br>
Oh get around get away<br>
'Tis a company of cowards<br>
And they've come to save the day<br>
<br>
All men who bear the saber share the scandal of that day<br>
Napoleon would have died of shame to see them run away<br>
Remember George at Valley Forge made the British boys behave<br>
You can well imagine now he's rolling over in his grave<br>
<br>
Oh get around oh get around get around<br>
Oh get around get away<br>
'Tis a company of cowards<br>
And they've come to save the day</blockquote>

Many slaves were slowly getting freedom's taste<br>
As time-measured means, back then, to stop a war in haste<br>
The War Between the States, South's blood and honor mars<br>
They found their glorious flag: red and white with stars and bars<br>
<br>
A waving fabric cloth, honors white and colored red<br>
Reminds us of the promises that warring wounds had bled<br>
The purity in its blue, ladyhood's southern belle<br>
Rebels Lee, Jackson and Stuart, they never cease to tell<br>
<br>
Battle-borne and battered, proudly waves through all the fray<br>
Bullet-scarred and blood-stained, "never leave us" they did pray<br>
When Appomattox came, in marched the Rebel men<br>
They stacked their guns that caused this loss to assault the flag again<br>
<br>
The loss of Southern Cause so slow for legs that lag<br>
Never will the South surrender, its stars and bars displayed</blockquote>

<h3>Confederate Gray</h3>
<blockquote>Nighttime comes to Cumberland Mountain<br>
I hear the sound of the distant bell<br>
The birds all sing in the deep dark forest<br>
They sing a song I know so well<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Please don't go, please don't go<br>
Can't you see I love you so?<br>
But I've had to leave, Lord, I could not stay<br>
For I wore a coat of Confederate Gray<br>
<br>
I miss my home in the Cumberland Mountain<br>
I long to lay by my sweetheart's side<br>
The battle's won but there's no one singing<br>
Seems I hear true love cry<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Now I'm at home in the Cumberland Mountain<br>
I'll stay til Judgment is at hand<br>
My true love sings to me each evening<br>
It's hard for her to understand<br>

CHORUS<br>
<br>
And her tears fall silent on my grave<br>
For I wore a coat of Confederate gray<br>
For I wore a coat of Confederate gray</blockquote>

<h3>Confederate Soldier</h3>

Where the fire line led up where they kneeled<br>
A hush filled our ears as we began to pray<br>
The whole Union Army was asleep in our way<br>

CHORUS<br>
And I still remember you telling those lies<br>
They sooner ran through them then through my disguise<br>
Confederate soldier running through the night<br>
You should grab my hand and see my eye<br>
<br>
Well I thought we were safe til I heard the call<br>
A lonesome old bugle sang the devil's song<br>
Well, I dropped my rifle, picked up my speed<br>
My old horse in Georgia was all I did need<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Passing a homestead, saw a flickering light<br>
You motioned me inside out of the night<br>
You took off my coat, dear, and offered me some wine<br>
And when the soldiers came knocking, one of their own they did find<br>

Confederate soldier running through the night<br>
You should grab my hand and see my eye</blockquote>

<h3>Crossing the Wall (Pickett's Charge)</h3>
<blockquote>"Crossing the Wall" is a story about great grandfather, Griffith Creasy, a confederate soldier, Co. G, 28th Virginia Infantry when as an old man, he returned to Gettysburg to visit one last time the scene of Pickett's Charge where he fought and survived this famous battle. As he stands by the angle, he reminisces about the battle and shares the emotions of that day July 3, 1863. Just as he did, thousands of Union and Confederate Veterans came back to visit this bloodstained battlefield.<br>
<br>
I went back to the battlefield to visit just once more<br>
To see the scene of Pickett's charge where we fought in that war<br>
I walked out to the angle and stood beside the wall<br>
Recalled the face of thousands as they begin to fall<br>
<br>
We marched up here from Richmond with Robert E. Lee<br>
We came to fight the Yankees in eighteen sixty-three<br>
Two long days we struggled to drive them from this land<br>
And on the third we crossed this field to make our final stand<br>
<br>
As memories flooded back, tears rolled down my face<br>
I looked around at Gettysburg and saw a bloodstained place<br>
I saw my brothers dying and others who would fall<br>
I lived through the Rebel charge as we crossed this wall<br>
<br>
Through the smoke of battle, I saw their faces well<br>
Heard their cries of agony amid their Rebel yell<br>
I heard the cannons rumble and the muskets roar<br>
So many comrades crumbled gone forever more<br>
<br>
We charged across the angle in hopes of victory<br>
An awful fate awaited us there at that clump of trees<br>
We fought them hand-to-hand with swords and stones and guns<br>
But in the end, the fight was lost the boys in blue had won<br>
<br>
This battlefield is silent it's been nigh sixty years<br>
I still recall the thousands of comrades who were dear<br>
Soon I'll go to greet them on that other shore<br>
And one again we'll heed that call to charge across this wall<br>
<br>
Yes one more time we'll dress in gray to charge across this wall</blockquote>

<h3>The Curse of Cain</h3>
<blockquote>Another moon on the stinking Potomac<br>
I'll be ready when the dogs break their chains<br>
They’ve chased me like a thief through the dark roads of Virginia<br>
But if I had to I would do it all again<br>
<br>
Jefferson Davis is just a shadow<br>
No heart left in Robert E. Lee<br>
Useless, useless, they're all worse than cowards<br>
Every Confederate heart has cut me free<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/103634-i-think-i-have-done-well-though-i-am-abandoned">Abandoned with the curse of Cain upon me</a><br>
I am abandoned with the curse of Cain upon me<br>
<br>
Abraham Lincoln had it coming<br>
He had the blood of the Union to bear<br>
He may rise like a ghost in every dream north of Richmond<br>
But behind him I will always be there<br>

CHORUS (x2)</blockquote>

<h3>Damn Yankee Lad</h3>
<blockquote>I'm just a Damyankee way down in the South<br>
I love to kiss Southern belles in the mouth<br>
I laugh when they say all Damyankees are bad<br>
For nobody knows I'm a Damyankee Lad<br>
<br>
When I found old Sherman had left me behind<br>
A very strange notion came into my mind<br>
I dressed up in grey and I made up a spiel<br>
And I headed straight for the town of Mobile<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I'm having fun like I never have had<br>
Nobody knows I'm a Damyankee Lad<br>
<br>
Not far from Atlanta I heard people say<br>
Old Sherman had taken the food all away<br>
'Twas there that I smiled on a lovely Mad-dam<br>
Who fed me on honey and peaches and ham<br>
<br>
I stopped in the country and got in a tight<br>
Where six widows claimed me and had a big fight<br>
I had to be slick as a slippery eel<br>
To get on my way to the town of Mobile<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I got to Mobile and I found a Creole<br>
She captured my heart an' she captured my soul<br>
It's been twenty years since I made up my spiel<br>
And went on my Damyankee way to Mobile<br>
<br>
I've raised a fine family of girls and young men<br>
They swear that damn Yankees are all full of sin<br>
They'd call you a liar if you said their dad<br>
Had marched to Mobile as a Damyankee Lad<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
When I get so old that I'm ready to die<br>
I'll put on my uniform blue as the sky<br>
They'll march 'round my coffin and won't they get mad<br>
When they learn that I was a DamnYankee Lad<br>
<br>
I'm just a Damyankee way down in the South<br>
I love to kiss Southern belles in the mouth<br>
I laugh when they say all Damyankees are bad<br>
For nobody knows I'm a Damyankee Lad<br>

<h3>Darling Alalee</h3>
<blockquote>The song is originally from the pre-Civil War ballad called 'Ella Rhee.' It is, no doubt, from the Negro-minstrel stage, though its history is vague. The chorus is unchanged from the original but the verses in this version are of the post-Civil War era. It is the story of a slave who has run away from his master but longs for his love (Alalee, who is undoubtedly a slave also) and therefore wishes to return.<br>
<br>
Sweet Alalee, so dear to me<br>
She's gone for ever more<br>
My home was down in Tennessee<br>
Before the cruel war<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Then carry me back to Tennessee<br>
There's where I long to be<br>
Among the fields of yellow corn<br>
With my darling Alalee<br>
<br>
Oh why did I from day to day<br>
Keep wishing to be free<br>
And from my master run away<br>
And leave my Alalee<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
They said that I would soon be free<br>
And happy all the day<br>
And if they'll take me back again<br>
I'll never run away<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Dawn At Antietam</h3>
<blockquote>"Hope you enjoy my anti-war tribute to the common soldier at Antietam. Two-finger and clawhammer style banjo" (via Facebook group "Dedicated to Old Time Music" post)<br>
<br>
I am a rebel soldier a long way from home<br>
Am a rebel soldier a long way from home<br>
General Lee gave the order, north we must roam<br>
<br>
We marched all week, to Sharpsburg we did come<br>
Marched all week, to Sharpsburg we did come<br>
One thing I knew for sure is that I would never run<br>
<br>
We took our possition at Antietam Creek<br>
Took up our possition at Antietam Creek<br>
By the dawn's early rise, we could hear the cannons' shriek<br>
<br>
We saw the Yankee's come and bullets flying around<br>
Saw the Yankee's come and bullets fly around<br>
Our sargeant gave the order, "Boy's, hold your ground"<br>
<br>
I looked to my left and I looked to my right<br>
Looked to my left and I looked to my right<br>
Two friends were dead and two more were dying<br>
<br>
I fired my gun and a Yankee went down<br>
Fired my gun and a Yankee went down<br>
Gave up his last breath with a mournful sound<br>
<br>
We fought all day to keep Burnside off that bridge<br>
Fought all day to keep Burnside off that bridge<br>
By the bloody sun went down there were four thousand dead<br>
<br>
I am a fortunate man, I come out of there alive<br>
Am a fortunate man, I come out of there alive<br>
With one arm, one leg, and one good eye</blockquote>

<h3>Day of Liberty</h3>
<blockquote>The "Good Time Coming" is almost here!<br>
It was long, long, long on the way!<br>
Now run and tell Elijah to hurry up Pump<br>
And meet us at the gumtree down in the swamp<br>
To wake Nicodemus today<br>
<br>
Nicodemus, the slave was of African birth<br>
And was bought for a bagful of gold<br>
He was reckon'd as part of the salt of the earth<br>
But he died years ago, very old<br>
'Twas his last sad request so we laid him away<br>
In the trunk of an old hollow tree<br>
"Wake me up!" was his charge, "at the first break of day<br>
Wake me up for the great Jubilee!"<br>
Fellas don't you see the light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Almost gone, the gloomy night<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
Hi-ho, we gladly sing<br>
Aloud, loud our voices ring<br>
Good news, the Lord he bring<br>
Now let my people go, oh<br>
<br>
Just you look and see that light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Almost gone, the gloomy night<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
The Union folks they wait so long<br>
We think they never was coming, coming<br>
And Secesh he got so strong<br>
We think they never was coming<br>
<br>
Now Uncle Abe he say<br>
Come, Massa, while you may<br>
And for the slave he'll pay<br>
For he must let us go, oh<br>
<br>
Just you look and see that light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Oh, the blessed, blessed sight<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
He was a prophet -- at least was as wise<br>
For he told of the battles to come<br>
And he trembled with dread when he roll'd up his eyes<br>
And we heeded the shake of his thumb<br>
Though he clothed us with fear, yet the garments he wore<br>
Were in patches at elbow and knee<br>
And he still wears the suit that he used to of yore<br>
As he sleeps in the old hollow tree<br>
<br>
Just you look and see that light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Almost gone, the gloomy night<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
Nicodemus was never the sport of the lash<br>
Though the bullet has oft cross'd his path<br>
There were none of his masters so brave or so rash<br>
As to face such a man in his wrath<br>
Yet his great heart with kindness was filled to the brim<br>
He obeyed who was born to command<br>
But he long'd for the morning which then was so dim<br>
For the morning which now is at hand<br>
<br>
By folks in this sweet trust<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
We will fight and die for us<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
Yes, yes, we'llfight and sing<br>
Loud, loud our voices ring<br>
Soon, soon, the mighty king<br>
Will let his people<br>
<br>
Just you look and see that light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Now we'll help the Yankees fight<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
Oh, the Lord will bring it right<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
From this dreadful bloody fight<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
Shout, everyone shout and sing<br>
Aloud, let your voices ring<br>
Soon, soon the mighty King<br>
Will let his people go, oh<br>
<br>
Just you look and see that light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Yes, the Lord will bring it right<br>
The day of liberty's coming<br>
<br>
'Twas a long weary night -- we were almost in fear<br>
That the future was more than he knew<br>
'Twas a long weary night -- but the morning is near<br>
And the words of our prophet are true<br>
There are signs in the sky that the darkness is gone<br>
There are tokens in endless array<br>
For when the storm which has seemingly banished the dawn<br>
Only hastens the advent of day<br>
<br>
Just you look and see that light<br>
The day of liberty's coming, coming<br>
Yes, the Lord will bring it right<br>
The day of liberty's coming</blockquote>

<h3>Dear Sarah</h3>
<blockquote>Dear Sarah I’m stuck on a train bound for Richmond<br>
We marched down from Gurnstown uphill all the way<br>
At the train stop in Stanton, we pulled up and climbed on<br>
Then we just sat there for a night and a day<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
And the nights are long, but I write you ev’ry day<br>
And I hum a song that you used to sing<br>
The one of sweet William his love, Barbara Allen<br>
And how she was always a long ways away<br>
<br>
My insides are all torn from hard tack and parch corn<br>
My hat flew in a windstorm so the sun has turned me red<br>
The first chance to lie still I pull out your Bible<br>
But fall fast asleep before one verse is read<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Dear Sarah in parting keep me in your heart<br>
I do not drink or gamble ‘cause I promised you I’d do<br>
So as not to mislead you I did have a need to<br>
When we were surrounded and looked like we were through<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
The one of sweet William, his love Barbara Allen<br>
And how she was always a long ways away<br>
<br>
In Scarlet Town, I did dwell. There was a fair maid a-dwellin’<br>
Many men cried, well, for the love Barbara Allen.</blockquote>

<h3>Dear Sister</h3>
<blockquote>This could be my last letter<br>
I may never see the cotton fields of home again<br>
I miss you, dear sister<br>
Tonight I never felt so all alone<br>
<br>
And the fog was so thick<br>
That the Stones River stars<br>
Could scarcely invade<br>
The dread and the dark<br>
And all that I could see<br>
When I closed my eyes to dream<br>
Was home, sweet home<br>
<br>
In the camps around Forrest<br>
The midnight coals were glowing through the haze<br>
The union boys sang Hail Columbia, and<br>
We sang look away, look away<br>
<br>
Then a hush in the rain<br>
And there rose a sweet refrain<br>
In the dark before dawn<br>
And instead of battle songs<br>
The enemy and we all sang a melody<br>
Of Home, Sweet Home<br>
<br>
So if this is my last letter<br>
And I never see the cotton fields of home again<br>
And if I fall here at Stones River<br>
I know that God will bear away my soul<br>
To be with Him<br>
<br>
And I'll wait for you there<br>
Where all is bright and fair<br>
Where the light of his face<br>
Outshines the blue and gray<br>
Where all of humankind<br>
Yes every man will find<br>
His home, sweet home </blockquote>

<h3>Dixie/Marching Through Georgia</h3>
<blockquote><i>Instrumental</i></blockquote>

<h3>Dixieland</h3>
<blockquote>(Introduction from Steve Earle's 2004 Farm Aid performance [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivbNEXjuu_4">link</a>]): I have written a bunch of songs about the Civil War over the years, and I don't know why that is, but there's been a ton of them.  But I think I'm probably a little different from most Southerners who write songs about the Civil War in that I'm not a Southerner who believes that the Civil War was fought about states' rights -- I figure it was probably about slavery.  And the reason that I believe that is everything I've read about it leads me to believe that it was about slavery as slavery related to economics at the time. And I believe with all my heart when it gets right down to it, whether they tell us or not, all wars are fought about money.<br>
<br>
I stole this character outright from a book called <i>The Killer Angels</i> by Michael Shaara, which is a novel about the Battle of Gettysburg, and for those of you that have lives and don't sit around reading about the Civil War all the time, the guy in this song is a composite character based on three guys that actually lived and fought and two died fighting with the 20th Maine, at Gettysburg. And the 20th Maine was the unit at the end of the line on top of Little Roundtop the second day at Gettysburg, and if it hadn't been for them, all you motherfuckers would talk like me. It was close!<br>
<br>
But this character, Buster Kilrain, was like a lot of people that were professional soldiers in that war --  he was from Ireland -- and he believed that the reason he was fighting the Civil War, is he believed he was fighting a class war; he believed that the system that he saw in the Southern United States was the same system that he fought against in Ireland and left to avoid.  And it never ceases to amaze me the kind of pinko shit that you can sneak in on a bluegrass record -- I like my job.<br>
<br>
I am the Kilrain, and I'm a fightin' man and I come from County Clare<br>
And the Brits would hang me for a Fenian, so I took my leave of there<br>
And I crossed the ocean in the <i>Arrianne</i>, the vilest tub afloat<br>
And the captain's brother was a railroad man and he met us at the boat<br>
So I joined up with the 20th Maine; like I said, my friend, I'm a fighting man<br>
We're marching south in the pouring rain, we're all going down to Dixieland<br>
<br>
I am the Kilrain of the 20th Maine and we fight for Chamberlain<br>
'Cause he stood right with us when the Johnnies came like a banshee on the wind<br>
When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg, many a mother wept<br>
For many a good boy died there, sure, and the air smelled just like death<br>
I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine and I'd march to hell and back again<br>
For Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, we all going down to Dixieland<br>
<br>
I am the Kilrain of the 20th Maine, and I damn all gentlemen<br>
Whose only worth is their father's name and the sweat of a working man<br>
Well, we come from the farms and the city streets, a hundred foreign lands<br>
And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat, now we're all Americans<br>
I am the Kilrain of the 20th Maine -- did I tell you, friend, I'm a fightin' man?<br>
And I'll not be back this way again 'cause we're all goin' down to Dixieland</blockquote>

<h3>Dodsworth Drum</h3>
<blockquote>Listen, friends, I've a tale of going to fight<br>
The rhythm of death on an old rawhide<br>
Old bass drum came straight from hell<br>
Dodsworth drum played and the angels cried<br>
<br>
It was '61 at the First Bull Run<br>
Beauty and hope sprouted<br>
Saw many men died on either side<br>
While the Dodsworth drum beat counted<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
From the horror of Manassas to Abraham's final run<br>
The beat told out the answer, no good would ever come<br>
On morning, see the sunrise, a happy tune you'll hum<br>
When you hear the sound of Carl's Dodsworth drum<br>
<br>
Gettysburg called to the nation<br>
A more stirring address was never heard<br>
A clarion call of things to come<br>
And along played Dodsworth drum<br>
<br>
When the war was done and Lincoln had won<br>
The president savior of the doomed<br>
That Southerner decreed then shot like a thief<br>
In a theater with Dodsworth drum drummed<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
As the funeral passed and people lost hope<br>
The hunt for Abe's killer was done<br>
The conspirators danced at the end of a rope<br>
And I swear to the beat of a drum<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
When you hear the sound of Carl's Dodsworth drum</blockquote>

<h3>Drummer Boy Of Shiloh</h3>
<blockquote>From Miss Pearle Webb, Pineola, Avery county. It may be one of "several song ballads" sent Dr. Brown on July 29, 1921. Compared with the printed version in <i>Allan's Lone Star Ballads</i>, Miss Webb's version shows several differences in the order and the diction of the drummer boy's prayer, and it simplifies the account of the burial.<br>
<br>
On Shiloh's dark and bloody plain<br>
The dead and dying lay.<br>
Among them was a drummer boy<br>
That beat the drum that day.<br>
<br>
A wounded soldier held him up;<br>
His drum lay by his side.<br>
He raised his eyes and clasped his hands<br>
And prayed before he died.<br>
<br>
'I love my country and my God;<br>
To serve them have I tried.'<br>
He smiled, shook hands; death seized the boy<br>
Who prayed before he died:<br>
<br>
<br>'Angels around the throne of Grace,<br>
Look down from heaven on me.<br>
Receive me in thy fond embrace<br>
And carry me home to thee.'<br>
<br>
Each soldier wept then like a child.<br>
Stout heart and brave were they<br>
Who mourned the loss of the drummer boy<br>
Who beat the drum that day.<br>
<br>
They wrote upon a single board,<br>
Each word it was a guide;<br>
They mourned the loss of the drummer boy<br>
That prayed before he died.<br>
<br>
Angels around the throne of Grace<br>
Look down upon the brave<br>
Who fought and died on Shiloh's plains<br>
And now slumbers in the grave.</blockquote>

<h3>Dry Creek Run</h3>
<blockquote>Thirteen hundred died that day<br>
It took ten good men just to dig the grave<br>
Burried them shallow, they burried them deep<br>
Burried them next to Dry Run Creek<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And their momma's cried<br>
Oh my Lord, how their momma's cried<br>
<br>
Well, they weren't just blue and they weren't just gray<br>
Death took no sides when it came that day<br>
They laid them down side by each<br>
They placed no stones at their head or feet<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
When the digging was through they gathered round<br>
A lonesome dove made the only sound<br>
They said prayers, got to their feet<br>
They left their friends at Dry Run Creek<br>
<br>
War'd been over for about a week<br>
Word hadn't gotten to dry run creek<br>
Fought and died right to the end<br>
A battle that shoulda never been<br>
<br>

<h3>The Federal Soldier</h3>
<blockquote>West Virginia broke away after Virginia's secession from the Union. In the border states, depredations were numerous. Ron has this from Sherman Hammons and sister Maggie, whose ancestors migrated from Kentucky to West Virginia at the time of the Civil War.<br>
<br>
One morning, one morning, one morning in May<br>
A pretty young soldier, lamenting and saying<br>
"O Molly, my dear Molly, it's from you I must roam<br>
And leave my aging father, my country, and my home<br>
<br>
I bid farewell to old Kentucky, no longer can I stay<br>
Hard times and the rebels, they're driving me away<br>
Hard times and the rebels are causing me to roam<br>
I am a Federal soldier far from my home<br>
<br>
I will build me a castle on yonders mountains high<br>
Where the wild geese can hear me as they go passing by<br>
Some turtle dove may hear me, and come to me to mourn<br>
I am a Federal soldier, and far from my home<br>
<br>
So here's a glass of good old whiskey, and a bottle of port wine<br>
So you can drink to your true love while I will mourn for mine<br>
For to go with General Burnside, his army now to roam<br>
I am a Federal soldier, and far from my home</blockquote>

<h3>Final Reward</h3>
<blockquote>Walk through the valley with me, young soldier<br>
Let me take the breath from your life<br>
Your mother may lay there, sound asleepin'<br>
At your age you'll never know a wife<br>
<br>
They held Atlanta, boys, they tried<br>
But soon she fell by the way<br>
Let's drink to the memory of those who died<br>
For in ashes our Georgia lays<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
He's gone to his final reward<br>
Seen the savior's sword<br>
Touch the coat of Robert E. Lee<br>
Like it was the garment of the Lord<br>
<br>
This country was built on arrogance<br>
And the blood of the fallen men<br>
When brother shot brother those years ago<br>
Let it not happen here again<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Well, let us rise up now to become<br>
Greater than we were before<br>
The colors on this here flag<br>
Yes, in that fire been forged<br>

<h3>The First Shot</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/12/mode/2up?q=brigade"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
Black clouds of war was hovering o'er the Southland like a plague<br>
The North and South, both thought was right, marched proudly for their flag<br>
In President Buchanan's time, his last four months in power<br>
The Union disintegrated, Congress watched its faded flower<br>
<br>
Six states from the Union then withdrew, gave loyalty the riot<br>
For guardsmen shelled Fort Sumter, and that was the first shot<br>
Then fears of Carolina folk hoorayed in Southern mind<br>
General Lee and Jackson stook a stand, for a vengeance they would vie<br>
<br>
If then they could have only known the sorrow war would bring<br>
The first shot would have not been fired on enemy or friend<br>
So many thousand died in vain, the soldiers do believe<br>
If that first shot had not been fired, peace might have been achieved<br>
<br>
The shoulder-to-shoulder tactics used by rifled muskets changed<br>
Too soon to many clumps of dead, to a defensive war arranged<br>
Today we decorate their graves, their honor marks the spot<br>
They lost their lives on the battlefield all because of one first shot</blockquote>

<h3>Following This Ghost</h3>
<blockquote>In a 2020 FaceBook livestream (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/curtisellermusic/videos/864465144307144">link</a>), Eller explained the origins of the song as follows: "I sing a lot about the Civil War and stuff like that.  And it seems like any time there's a war or anything like that, somebody gets totally forgotten, and of course, back in those days, whether you were on the North or the South, if you're a woman, you got left behind. Just trying to make things... work out, you know?"<br>
<br>
I remember thinking it was over<br>
And that man of mine would soon be coming home<br>
But nowadays you can't depend on nothing<br>
And I never can get drunk in this house all alone<br>
And the falling of the shadows wakes me up when I need you most<br>
And I'm so tired of following this ghost<br>
<br>
The picture frame on the fireplace has rusted<br>
And Abraham Lincoln can go to Hell<br>
Well, for all I care this civil war is just murder<br>
And your yellowed face don't hardly ring a bell<br>
And the rumors out of Richmond echo down in the morning post<br>
And I'm so tired of following this ghost<br>
Oh, I'm so tired of following this ghost<br>
<br>
My nights all burn up in this heat and turn to steam<br>
But I know they're drinking on that battlefield<br>
And praying every night just makes me mean<br>
<br>
I'm not asking much, I'm just saying that I can't stay up<br>
And if this thing is ever done<br>
Don't bother and wake me up to say who won<br>
<br>
And the summers are longer every year<br>
And the wind don't blow down the southeast coast<br>
And I'm so tired of following this ghost<br>
Oh, I'm so tired of following this ghost</blockquote>

<h3>The General</h3>
<blockquote>Andrew's Union raiders set out to undermine<br>
The Western Atlantic railroad line<br>
From Georgia to Chattanooga, we'd tear up the track<br>
Cut Southern supply lines, make way for a Union attack<br>
<br>
Listen to the train, the <i>General</i>, listen to the train<br>
Listen to the train, The <i>General</i>, listen to the train<br>
<br>
Oh, down in North Georgia, in the Spring of '62<br>
All of the passengers and the <i>General</i>'s crew<br>
Stumped up for breakfast in Big Shanty town<br>
While eighteen Ohio boys made of with The <i>General</i> Tennessee-bound<br>
<br>
We sped to the North destroying as we'd go<br>
But our luck ran out over by Jericho<br>
We pulled up the track, cut telegraph wires<br>
Pursued by Conferate trainmen on the <i>Texas</i> high-flyer<br>
<br>
The <i>Texas</i> high-flyer was hot in pursuit<br>
Ran in reverse, closed the gap on our route<br>
Just north of Ringgold we ran out of steam<br>
Got 87 miles to the end of our dream<br>
<br>
Captured and hung in Atlanta one day<br>
Oh, we did some damage but Hell was to pay<br>
We didn't change a battle, we didn't change the war<br>

<h3>Gettysburg Recalled</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/28/mode/2up?q=gettysburg"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
On the evening before the Battle of Gettysburg<br>
It was around about nine that night<br>
The Rebel men gathered and beautiful songs<br>
Were sung to the soldiers' delight<br>
<br>
Then singing and gaiety ended<br>
The Federals replied tunes in kind<br>
Dixie and Aura Lee then filled the air<br>
Thoughts of loved ones and home filled their mind<br>
<br>
On Rappahannock's banks these two armies<br>
Quietly listened to the words of Home Sweet Home<br>
While a hundred thousand men were regrouping<br>
On the morrow they'll be covered with loam<br>
<br>
Cannons and muskets and sabers were used<br>
Hitting hard into General Pickett's lines<br>
Out of fifteen-thousand, eleven only reached the angle's end<br>
Retreating rebels left their dead on the vines<br>
<br>
In Gettysburg's armageddon battle<br>
General Lee lost twenty thousand men<br>
The tide suddenly turned with its rattle<br>
General Grant knew the war would soon end<br>
<br>
Gettysburg will always be remembered<br>
For this was the turning point of the war<br>
Now today, we're a nation united<br>
There's no hatred remembered anymore</blockquote>

<h3>The Giant On the Thunderhead</h3>
<blockquote>A bunch of Rebel soldiers were sittin' 'round one night<br>
A-talkin' to some Yankees in a spot way out of sight<br>
They'd stepped across the picket line to have a little chat<br>
A chawin' their tobaccer and swappin' this and that<br>
<br>
And while they were a-talkin' they looked a-way up high<br>
And there they saw a man a-walkin' across the moonless sky<br>
He sat down on a pillow upon a thunderhead<br>
He looked down on the soldiers and this is what He said:<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
You Yankees and you Rebels, shake hands and then caress<br>
Go home and read your Bible and the Gettysburg Address<br>
<br>
The boys ran to their bed rolls afraid to talk out loud<br>
About the mighty giant they'd saw upon the cloud<br>
Next day two famous general met near an apple tree<br>
And one of them was U.S. Grant and one was Robert Lee<br>
<br>
And when they'd finished talking and everybody knew<br>
The awful war was over, they shouted Hallelu'<br>
And all the people wondered about the thunderhead<br>
Did U.S. Grant and Robert Lee hear what the giant said?<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
You'll never build a nation in all this bloody mess<br>
Go home and read your Bible and the Gettysburg Address<br>
You've got the grandest country this world has ever known<br>
Your Constitution is the brightest star that's ever shone<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Go home and read your Bible and the Gettysburg Address</blockquote>

<h3>Git Along Little Yearlings</h3>
<blockquote>The Yanks took our corn, the Rebs took our cotton<br>
The bank took our land and the tax got our home<br>
We yoked up our oxen, then loaded our wagons<br>
With a drove of poor yearlings we started to roam<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Git along, little yearlings, we're a-going to Texas<br>
Don't stray far away or you can't hear the bell<br>
Git along, little yearlings, we're a-going to Texas<br>
Stay close to the wagons and all will be well<br>
<br>
Twas in Alabama we lost our first wagon<br>
We thanked the good Lord we'd lost only one<br>
In ol' Mississippi we fought the Jayhawkers<br>
And in Lou'siana we buried a son<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
There's bears in the woods, and there's wolves and there's Indians<br>
There's quick sandy holes and there's mountains of stone<br>
Last night a poor yearling strayed too far from camp<br>
And this morning we found just a bundle of bones<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Hooray and hurrah, give a big Hallelujah<br>
The journey is ending, we're very near there<br>
Give thanks to the oxen and pray to Jehova<br>
We'll soon be a-resting beneath the Lone Star<br>

<h3>God Didn't Choose Sides</h3>
<blockquote>“As soon as we reached the water’s edge, we began to sing that grand old hymn ‘There is a Fountain Filled with Blood’ and at once the enemy began to leave their works and hastened to the riverside.” -Reverend Willie Ragland, Chaplain of the 13th Virginia Brigade.<br>
<br>
In December 1863, the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia came together over the Rapidan River, not in violence, but in song. Though just days before they were locked in bloody conflict, on this cold morning God was praised as they sang together the old hymn, “There is a Fountain Filled with Blood”, while a Confederate soldier (Goodwin from Company A) was baptized by the Confederate Chaplain. Despite being enemies, the tired and homesick men laid down their weapons to celebrate Jesus, and embrace the truth that God didn’t choose sides.<br>
<br>
On a river in Virginia, in the middle of a war<br>
There were Rebels on the south side, and Yankees on the north<br>
The sounds of war fell silent til all that could be heard<br>
Were the songs of faith in Jesus, both sides knew them word for word<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
God didn't choose sides 'tween the Blue and Gray<br>
He didn't choose sides, in His eyes they were the same<br>
For every man who died, Heaven's arms were open wide<br>
They'd hear "Soldier, welcome home. God didn't choose sides"<br>
<br>
Now on both riverbanks together, souls of Blue and Gray were saved<br>
They were baptized in the waters were blood had flowed that day<br>
Some soon would meet in Heaven, where on common, peaceful ground<br>
All husbands, sons, and fathers, finally laid their weapons down<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
For every man who died, Heaven's arms were open wide<br>
They'd hear "Soldier, welcome home. God didn't choose sides"</blockquote>

<h3>Going Across the Mountain</h3>
<blockquote>Going across the mountain<br>
Oh, fare you well<br>
Going across the mountain<br>
You can hear my banjo tell<br>
<br>
Got my rations on my back<br>
My powder it is dry<br>
I'm a-goin' across the mountain<br>
Chrissie, don't you cry<br>
<br>
Going across the mountain<br>
To join the boys in blue<br>
When this war is over<br>
I'll come back to you<br>
<br>
Going across the mountain<br>
If I have to crawl<br>
To give old Jeff's men<br>
A little of my rifle ball<br>
<br>
Way before it's good daylight<br>
If nothing happens to me<br>
I'll be way down yander<br>
In old Tennessee<br>
<br>
I expect you'll miss me when I'm gone<br>
But I'm going through<br>
When this war is over<br>
I'll come back to you<br>
<br>
Going across the mountain<br>
Oh, fare you well<br>
Going across the mountain<br>
Oh, fare you well.</blockquote>

<h3>Goodbye Little Darlin</h3>

That your Johnny's gone to take a Rebel stand<br>

So goodbye little darlin'<br>
You will hear my heart callin'<br>
As I turn and go down 'round the bend<br>

If I cross o'er the river<br>
I will hold you in my arms again<br>

Often shall I think of you<br>
And my longing heart will be forever true<br>
If by chance that I am slain<br>
Please place a laurel wreath o'er my grave<br>

<h3>The Grey Ghost</h3>
<blockquote><i>Instrumental</i></blockquote>

<h3>Greycoat Soldiers</h3>
<blockquote>Where the cold, clear mountain spring did roll<br>
The green beech tree hung ‘cross the road<br>
Iron rim wagons caught the sun<br>
Back in the year of sixty-one<br>
<br>
Now Sherman’s army marched around<br>
In 64, he burned Georgia down<br>
Settings wings to the feet<br>
Of every living soul he’d meet<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Graycoat Soldiers have gone<br>
Marching in a ragged war<br>
Young wives and babies cried alone<br>    
For fathers, they saw no more<br>
<br>
Well, they tore up rails and wrecked the bridge<br>
Down by the hill they call Mission Ridge<br>
Hell it raged for days and nights<br>
An end it seemed was not in sight<br>
<br>
Well they loaded up the cannon with nails and chains<br>
A noise that would drive a man insane<br>
Rifles rang sharp and loud<br>
In that battle above the clouds<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Graycoat Soldiers have gone<br>
Marching in a ragged war<br>
Young wives and babies cried alone<br>
For fathers, they saw no more<br>
<br>
Now they’re all gone to the rocks and the hills<br>
And the green grave yard on the hill<br>
And no one does recall the day<br>
Corporal Johnson rode away<br>
And cast iron markers they stand there<br>
Guarding the battleground with care<br>
Cannons rest all in a row<br>
Prepared to meet some ghostly foe<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Harder Than Steel</h3>
<blockquote>Have you heard the red hawk's cry<br>
In the morning high on Roan Mountain<br>
When the sun comes up over Carolina hills<br>
The wind sweeps softly through the pines<br>
<br>
Have you seen the blue smoke rise<br>
From the chimney down in the valley<br>
Where the big water wheel turns the iron ore to steel<br>
Harder than a heart that's made of stone<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
The trail winds up past the rocks and the balds of the Roan<br>
And it's leading me back to the old home 'neath the pines<br>
Why did I decide to roam?<br>
<br>
I had shared the stream with the wounded<br>
I washed my eyes that were blind from the gunsmoke<br>
And when the fighting was all done and we knew that we had won<br>
We laid our brothers in the ground<br>
<br>
Every spring I return to Roan Mountain<br>
Just to search for the heart that was lost there<br>
And I look for the stones that mark long forgotten bones<br>
Harder than the steel that cut them down<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Have you heard the red hawk's cry<br>
In the morning high on Roan Mountain<br>
When the sun comes up over Carolina hills<br>
Why did I decide to roam?</blockquote>

<h3>Hardtack and Salt Pork</h3>
<blockquote>Hardtack and salt pork was standard food issue to soldiers of the Union Army, and because of its ability to remain safe to eat for long periods of time, it was issued in plentiful amounts to troops on the move, marching from one location to another or one battle to another. Soldiers grew to dislike the steady diet of salt pork and hardtack and complained vigorously about it, but because of hunger and the lack of other food, they ate it anyway. From another point of view, Robert Catlett Cave, of the 13th Virginia Infantry, related that upon securing a Union haversack containing hardtack and raw pork from the field following a battle, he scraped the raw pork and spread it on the hardtack. He said, "I found it to be rather tasty." (<u>Hardtack and Raw Pork</u>) The song pokes fun at its constant issue and tells the sad but funny tale of the ordinary soldier's feeling toward it.<br>
<br>
Well it's hardtack and salt-pork to eat every day<br>
We dont like it, it's the Army way<br>
I swear I won't take it but do any way<br>
So it's hardtack and salt-pork to again today<br>
<br>
One day they gave us beans and cornbread<br>
But the cornbread had weevils that weren't even dead<br>
We were happy to get it -- it sure were a treat<br>
Cause hardtack and salt-pork just ain't hard to beat<br>
<br>
Well they sent me to prison but I ran away<br>
Cause dinner was rat soup and rice every day<br>
I went back to my unit without delay<br>
And was happy for hardtack and salt-pork that day<br>
<br>
We found some green apples and ate them instead<br>
In just a few hours we wished we were dead<br>
Cause this old dysentery it sure is a fright<br>
We were glad to get hardtack and salt-pork that night<br>
<br>
Whenever we wake up, the men always pray<br>
That we won't have hardtack and salt-pork that day<br>
They all ask for biscuits and gravy and steak<br>
But there's only two things that the Army can make<br>
<br>
I've ate so much hardtack and salt-pork by now<br>
That when I find water I drink it all down<br>
When this war is over if we loose or win<br>
I will never eat hardtack or salt-pork again<br></blockquote>

<h3>He Had A Long Chain On</h3>
<blockquote>At the beginning of the Civil War the men in Arkansas where I [Jimmy Driftwood] live, Searcy and later Stone Counties, said they would not fight against the U.S. Government, neither would they fight against their friends in the South. They were rounded up and captured by the southern army and marched away to Little Rock in chains. I was told there were 100 of them and the odd man just wore a ball and chain whereas the other 99 were chained in three's. The man with the ball and chain got into the thick willows in a creek near my home and got away according to legend. He never was captured nor would he ever let the welded chain be cut off his body. Wherever I have sung this song, there have been differences of opinion as to its meaning. Alan Lomax thinks this is one of the greatest songs he has ever heard and he said, "Let each individual interpret it for himself."<br>
<br>
One night as I lay on my pillow<br>
Moonlight as bright as the dawn<br>
I saw a man a-walking<br>
He had a long chain on<br>
<br>
I heard his chain a-clanking<br>
It made a mournful sound<br>
Welded around his body<br>
Dragging along the ground<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
He had a long chain on<br>
He had a long chain on<br>
He had a long chain on<br>
<br>
He stood beside my window<br>
He looked at me and he said<br>
"I am so tired and hungry<br>
Give me a bite of your bread"<br>
<br>
He didn't look like a robber<br>
He didn't look like a thief<br>
His voice was as soft as the moonlight<br>
His face full of sorrow and grief<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I went into my kitchen<br>
Got him a bowl full of meat<br>
A drink and a pan of cold biscuits<br>
That's what I gave him to eat<br>
<br>
Though he was tired and hungry<br>
A bright light came over his face<br>
He bowed his head in the moonlight<br>
He said a beautiful grace<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I fetched my hammer and chisel<br>
Offered to set him free<br>
He shooked his head and said sadly<br>
"I guess we had best let it be"<br>
<br>
When he had finished his supper<br>
He thanked me again and again<br>
Though it's been years since I've seen him<br>
Still hear him draggin' his chain<br></blockquote>

<h3>He Walked All the Way Home</h3>
<blockquote>In the grim and final hour of the War between the States<br>
He had enough dying, all the grief that he could take<br>
From the Appamattox Courthouse, where the deed was sadly done<br>
There was no place left for him to go but home<br>
<br>
He walked all the way home to Southampton County<br>
To carry all he owned and try to forget<br>
Wearing sadness like a mantle for the friends he lost in vain<br>
He walked all the way home to start his life again<br>
<br>
In the end he knew the reasons but so many had been lost<br>
For years to come the fallen would sleep beneath the cross<br>
What he held in angry silence, time could never burn away<br>
It was just the saddest price he'd ever pay<br>
<br>
He walked all the way home to Southampton County<br>
To carry all he owned and try to forget<br>
Wearing sadness like a mantle for the friends he lost in vain<br>
He walked all the way home to start his life again<br>
<br>
When he stopped to take some water at a little roadside place<br>
A pretty southern widow sadly looked into his face<br>
As they talked a while his blue eyes seemed to ease her broken heart<br>
One day he came back and took her home<br>
<br>
He walked all the way home to Southampton County<br>
To carry all he owned and try to forget<br>
Wearing sadness like a mantle for the friends he lost in vain<br>
He walked all the way home to start his life again<br>
<br>
He walked all the way home to start his life again</blockquote>

<h3>He's Coming To Us Dead</h3>
<blockquote>Norm Cohen, in <i>Long Steel Rail: The Railroad In American Folksong</i>, states "There is nothing in the text of this song to link it unequivocally with either the Civil War or the Spanish-American War. The pieces was published in 1899 with words and music credited to Gussie L. Davis... however it was not uncommon for sentimental songs to be published in the 1890s that dealt with the Civil War. (Nor is it out of the question that Davis rewrote an earlier song or poem, as he did in the case of 'In the Baggage Coach Ahead.')"<br>
<br>
Text from <i>Songs As Sung by J. E. Mainer and His Mountaineers</i> (1967)<br>
<br>
One morning when the office had opened, a man came over here<br>
To the express office, showing signs of grief and fear.<br>
When the clerk approached him, with trembling words to say:<br>
"I'm waiting for my boy sir, he's coming home today."<br>
<br>
["]You have made a sad mistake, and you must surely know<br>
This is a telegraph office sir, and not a town depot.<br>
If your boy is coming home, this perfect mother's day<br>
You'll find him with the passengers, at th station over the way.["]<br>
<br>
"You do not understand me sir," the old man shook his head<br>
"He's not coming as a passenger, but by express", he said.<br>
"He's coming home to mother," the old man gently said<br>
"He's coming in a casket sir, he's coming to us dead."<br>
<br>
Then a whistle pierced the air, the express came in on time<br>
The old man raised in a breathless speech and quickly rushed outside.<br>
Then a long white casket was lowered to the ground<br>
It showed a sign of grief and fear for those who gathered around.<br>
<br>
"Do not use him so roughly boys, for that contains our darling Jack<br>
He went away as you boys are, this is the way he's coming back.<br>
He broke his poor old mother's heart, these things come true<br>
And this is the way they all come back when they join the boys in blue."</blockquote>


<h3>Heading South</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
I'm headed South to North Carolina<br>
This tar on my heels won't slow me down<br>
Four years I've been gone and trying to get back home<br>
To a little girl I left there crying<br>
In our cabin in the Carolina pines<br>
<br>
In Virginia we got our parole<br>
And the Colonel said that we could go<br>
He didn't have to tell me twice, I was through with all the fights<br>
So many battles fought even though our cause that was lost<br>
<br>
Goodbye to the lonely nights on picket<br>
Goodbye to the moldy hard-tack biscuits<br>
Not more cussin', screamin', cryin', no more watching my friends dyin'<br>
Now I put my dirt feet on that old dusty road<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
When I kissed her at our cabin door<br>
So many tears I've never seen before<br>
But I remembered every day the last words she had to say<br>
Right here I'll always be, oh, she's thinking back to me<br>

<h3>Heroes</h3>
<blockquote>Jackson fell in Chancellorsville, and his own men shot him down<br>
May the 12th in '63, they laid old Jackson down<br>
General Lee lost his right arm when he laid old Jackson down<br>
Yeah, they laid old Stonewall down<br>
<br>
JEB Stuart was next in line to fill old Jackson's shoes<br>
To stand up to a Stonewall had to be hard to do<br>
Then May the 10th in '64 they got old JEB Stuart too<br>
Lord, they got old JEB Stuart too<br>
<br>
A.P. Hill was next in line before the fight was through<br>
He rode hard at Petersburg to aide his battered troops<br>
Then a Yankee bullet found his heart and A.P. Hill was through<br>
Oh, A.P. Hill was through<br>
<br>
Chancellorsville and Yellow Tavern, sacred southern ground<br>
Petersburg, then on to glory, heroes will be found<br>
<br>
And when the final armageddon turns this world around<br>
And Jesus comes back to sounds of trumpets through the land<br>
I'll bet that Jackson, Stuart and Hill will be on His right hand<br>
Will be on His right hand<br>
<br>
Chancellorsville and Yellow Tavern, sacred southern ground<br>
Petersburg, then on to glory, heroes will be found<br>
<br>
Heroes will be found<br>
Heroes will be found</blockquote>

<h3>Hold The Line</h3>
<blockquote>Been marching on this old road since the break of day<br>
Quick-stepping all the way<br>
This time we'll have the high ground and we'll be here to stay<br>
If they hit us now, well, they'll hell to pay<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Hold the line, boys, hold the line<br>
They're forming up to hit us one more time<br>
We can't let 'em break us 'cause it could turn the tide<br>
Close 'em up, we've gotta hold the line<br>
<br>
We finished up the trenches across the valley road<br>
Really had that dirt a-flyin'<br>
Then the Colonel says we got 'em, they're in for a hard time<br>
We got good ground if we'll just hold the line<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Earlier they hit us with a mighty valiant charge<br>
All we saw was men in blue<br>
Boy, they really pressed us but they broke at fifty yards<br>
But they're coming back and we know just what to do<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Boys, hold the line<br>
They're forming up to hit us one more time<br>
We can't let 'em break us 'cause it could turn the tide<br>
Close 'em up, we've gotta hold the line</blockquote>

<h3>How Do You Like the Army</h3>
<blockquote>Whiskey is good medicine, it helps with great and small<br>
But when you're in the army, headquarters gets it all<br>
They drink it by the barrel, the drink it by the yard<br>
But if a private touches it they put him under guard<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Oh, how do you like the army, the rootin'-tootin' army<br>
The high-falutin army where the soldier is a mule<br>
Oh, how do you like the army, the rootin'-tootin' army<br>
The high-falutin army where the big brass buttons rule<br>
<br>
The generals eat the chicken til they cackle in their sleep<br>
The colonels and the captains eat all the cows and sheep<br>
When soldiers get so hungry they steal a mangy pig<br>
The biggest dump in Dixie they're sure to have to dig<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
And when we take a city they put us all on duty<br>
The general and his officers go in to judge the beauty<br>
The generals get the choices, the majors get the pickin's<br>
The captains get the servants and the privates get the dickens<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>A Hundred Years Ago</h3>
<blockquote>In 1861 in it was, a hundred years ago<br>
Our nation went to battle in a war that's shamed us so<br>
Brother against brother, father against son<br>
The Yankee bayonet against the Southern rebel gun<br>
<br>
A hundred years ago, a hundred years ago<br>
At Gettysburg the soldiers prayed<br>
The shots were fired, the taps were played<br>
A hundred years ago<br>
<br>
Now it was at Fort Sumter that the bloody stage was set<br>
For this great war our nation soon would not forget<br>
Cousin killing cousin, so the story's told<br>
Before the end we were to lose five hundred thousand bold<br>
<br>
A hundred years ago, a hundred years ago<br>
General Grant and General Lee<br>
Shaped our nation's destiny<br>
A hundred years ago<br>
<br>
Vicksburg, Bull Run, Shiloh, Richmond, Chattanooga, too<br>
Were the many battlegrounds where Greycoats met the Blue<br>
Strewn with wounded Yankees dying in the mud<br>
Wet with tears of anguish and all red with Rebel blood<br>
<br>
Our nation suffered so let us now recall<br>
For it must stand united or divided it will fall<br>
If we learn the lesson the war has earned its worth<br>
Our nation here united shall not perish from the earth<br>
<br>
A hundred years ago (great God!), a hundred years ago<br>
Our leaders sighed, they fought and died<br>
While widows wept and mothers cried<br>
A hundred years ago</blockquote>

<h3>I'm a Pore Rebel Soldier</h3>
<blockquote>My Molly won't love me and she won't tell me why<br>
So I'll jine Price's army and fight til I die<br>
I don't mind the Federals, they jest make me made<br>
But when Molly won't love me, it hurts me so bad<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I'm a pore Rebel soldier a long ways from home<br>
The fusses and the Federals won't leave me alone<br>
The fusses and the Federals have caused me to roam<br>
I'm a pore Rebel soldier a long ways from home<br>
<br>
My mammy's against me, she says it's a shame<br>
To go with the Rebels if fightin's my game<br>
My brother's ole Sherman and my dad is ole Grant<br>
But I'll stay with Price til they take off my pants<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
They say it's all over, Price laid down the law<br>
So I'll go back home and have hell with my pa<br>
They may take my country and they may take my gun<br>
But I'll still be Rebel and a true Southern son<br>
<br>
I'll hang up my rifle and give up my gin<br>
And hope that my Molly will love me again<br>
I'll build me a cabin on the mountaintop high<br>
I'll be a good rebel til the day that I die<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>I'm Almost Home</h3>
<blockquote>Theodrick “Tod” Carter was the tenth child of Fountain and Mary Carter and grew up in the quiet village of Franklin, Tennessee. In the Spring of 1861, Tod left a promising law career to follow his older brother into the Confederate Army. Tod’s love of adventure led him to thrive in the army, and he quickly became Captain Carter. In 1864, Tod found himself only a few miles from home. Energized by the thought of seeing his family, Carter volunteered to lead the 20th Tennessee Infantry in a charge toward the Union lines entrenched just south of Franklin, shouting “follow me boys, I’m almost home!” Tod was mortally wounded in the battle yards from his doorstep. His father found him, and after three years away from home, he died in his front parlor surrounded by his family.<br>
<br>
The tenth child born in the early spring, never wanted for much of anything<br>
Most of his life had things his way, 'til black and white turned Blue and Gray<br>
A volunteer soon deployed, just another sandy haired rebel boy<br>
Tennessee born and bred, his Southern blood he gladly shed<br>
<br>
Heard the news from John Bell Hood, the Federal boys were up to no good<br>
Dug in deep on Columbia Pike, won't give it up without a fight<br>
He jumped up on his dapple gray, volunteered to lead the fray<br>
With sabre high and a rebel yell, "c'mon boys, let's give 'em hell"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
A thousand miles and a thousand days<br>
Brought him back here to this place<br>
Where once in simpler times he'd roam<br>
"Follow me boys, I'm almost home!"<br>
<br>
Huddled in the basement there, the sound of cannons through the air<br>
Never once did it cross their minds, their youngest son on the field they'd find<br>
From this world of sorrow torn, in the very house where he was born<br>
As his father said, "You've done your best," he drifted off and took his rest<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>I'm Going Home Tonight</h3>
<blockquote>Most Civil War soldiers had not been more than a few miles from their homes, prior to joining the army, and then they found themselves perhaps hundreds of miles away. Thus, their thoughts of loved ones, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and often sweethearts frequented their minds and dreams. Somehow thinking these good thoughts of home helped them through the rigors and difficulties of long marches, poor food, housing, and battles of simply being a soldier at war. In the song, "I'm Going Home Tonight," a soldier escapes all death and dying of battle by dreaming of home and loved ones, and looks forward to sleep and his dreams.<br>
<br>
I left my home down in Kentucky<br>
To fight in this old civil war<br>
Most every day we fight a battle<br>
Every night, I escape once more<br>
<br>
I lay down on the cold hard ground<br>
Tired and weary from our fight<br>
Some of my comrades they didn't make it<br>
But I'm going home tonight<br>
<br>
I close my eyes and see sweet Becky<br>
Hold her in my arms so tight<br>
It's been a long time since I've seen her<br>
But I'm going home tonight<br>
<br>
Ma and Pa run out to greet me<br>
In their eyes love shines bright<br>
They throw their gentle arms around me<br>
And I'm there at home tonight<br>
<br>
There is no death or guns or battle<br>
In this place of peace and light<br>
Tomorrow a bullet might find me<br>
But I'm going home tonight<br>
<br>
From my dreams I wake come morn'in<br>
And prepare for one more fight<br>
If I make it through another day<br>
I'll go home again tonight<br></blockquote>

<h3>Jeb's Black Horse Brigade</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/72/mode/2up?q=black+horse"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
With the Civil War's 1861<br>
Three hundred and thirty four men from Fauquier County<br>
Each riding his own black horse<br>
Enlisted with Jeb's black horse brigade and was off seaking for a fight in war's bounty<br>
<br>
Now these horsemen were born to the saddle<br>
And they knew well how to ride a steed<br>
They rode and soon welded together<br>
A great corps of fighting hell and leather lead<br>
<br>
Now when McDowell's Union forces<br>
Were badgered into a fight<br>
Jeb Stuart's black horse cavalry<br>
Charged and the Federals broke and ran with fright<br>
<br>
Now when Jeb's sabre-riding cowboys<br>
Rode proud behind their black horse banner<br>
Bravely so rattled the Union morale<br>
They couldn't fight in any manner<br>
<br>
Fox hunters, planters, and just plain horsemen<br>
Made up this famous black devil brigade<br>
And they had the esprit de corps<br>
And courage of a huge cannon's accolade<br>
<br>
The swashbuckling and heroics exploits<br>
Of Stuart's chosen horses and men<br>
Surged forward two full years<br>
Before Yankees even learned horses, or how to stay on them<br>
<br>
But in due course of time<br>
As disease and casualties mounted<br>
Their black horses could not be replaced<br>
And the cause for Confederacy discounted<br>
<br>
Jeb Stuart's cavalry in Brandy Station's twilight<br>
Bumped into ten thousand horses and Union forces might<br>
The sad news came and General Lee knew<br>
The Federals had learned to ride and fight<br>
<br>
General Grant's blues never will forget<br>
Hampton, Jones, Forrest, and Fitzhugh Lee<br>
Equine princes Ashby and Stuart<br>
Before surrender finally stopped the victory.</blockquote>

<h3>Jenny's Mill</h3>
<blockquote>Those bluebells blooming near the waterwheel<br>
It's springtime in Virginia down by Jenny's Mill<br>
Well, the river bottom's calling for this land to be tilled<br>
It's springtime in Virginia down by Jenny's Mill<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
How many miles to Virginia<br>
When you're north of the Mason-Dixon Line<br>
There ain't enough Yankee bluecoats<br>
To keep me from springtime<br>
Down by Jenny's Mill<br>
<br>
Up the death-riddled road down Appomattox way<br>
Lincoln and Lee agreed the killing stops today<br>
Brother against brother, what's the fighting for?<br>
We all died a little in that bloody war<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Woah, as I travel back across the blood-stained hills<br>
I see makeshift cemeteries in barren burned-out fields<br>
What used to be a memory now I see is real<br>
Oh, it's eighteen hundred sixy five down by Jenny's Mill<br>

<h3>Jesse James</h3>
<blockquote>A mild-mannered country boy got a fire in his eyes<br>
When the Yankee soldiers and beat him while his daddy hung and died<br>
Jesee joined Quantrill's men when he turned fifteen<br>
He was born of a preacher man but he grew up hard and mean<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Jesse James, you left your name in the rebels hall of fame<br>
Jesse James, you left your name in the rebels hall of fame<br>
<br>
He was one-way ticket Rebel soldier and a damn good friend of mine<br>
Fighting for the Union Army wasn't what he had in mind<br>
Jesse joined Quantrill's men and he learned the outlaw ways<br>
The only thing that Jesse feared was his final judgment day<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
When the war was done, he gave his gun the Yankee soldiers, then<br>
On the way he home they shot him down and the hell broke loose again<br>
He robbed him twelve Yankee banks and seven northern trains<br>
Give 'em hell, Jesse James, give 'em again<br>

<h3>The Jingling Hole</h3>
<blockquote>(see also: <a href="https://bluegrasstoday.com/the-jingling-hole-from-linda-lay/">The Jingling Hole from Linda Lay</a> by John Lawless in <i>Bluegrass Today</i>)<br>
<br>
There's a place hidden in the Blue Ridge where the shadows meet the trees<br>
And a secret no one talks about but now the mountains keep<br>
For folks there in those mountains, there was no blue or gray<br>
They just wanted to be left alone to live life their own way<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
As the wind blows at night through the hollows<br>
If you close your eyes and listen with your soul<br>
The mountains may give up the gruesome story<br>
About the Jingling Hole<br>
<br>
Outsiders drew them to a fight they didn't care about<br>
They fought a war within a war to keep those strangers out<br>
Hidden in those mountains, a secret cave was found<br>
Where mountain justice could be served from a deep hole in the ground<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
An iron pipe securely fit across a small abyss<br>
Where captured enemies were forced to hang by fingertips<br>
With spurs attached to leather boots a dance would soon begin<br>
And the cave would hide screams of death that came from deep within<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
They just wanted to be left alone to live life their own way</blockquote>

<h3>John Wilkes Booth (Don't Make Us Beg)</h3>
<blockquote>John Wilkes Booth has let me down for the last time<br>
God help us if we can’t pull this rotten tooth<br>
I don’t care it the Civil War starts all over<br>
I’m through waiting for John Wilkes Booth<br>
<br>
We need a man like John Brown down in Harper’s Ferry<br>
Dreams jumping out of his head, you can watch ‘em burn<br>
Just a wild-eyed lunatic from Kansas<br>
Somebody to teach ‘em a lesson that’s gonna stay learned<br>
<br>
Where is John Wilkes Booth when we need him?<br>
To drop a match in this powder keg?<br>
That son of a bitch is up there in the balcony all alone<br>
C’mon, John Wilkes Booth don’t make us beg<br>
<br>
They’re dumping gasoline in the backyard, man I seen ‘em<br>
Draggin’ Herbert Hoover out of that hole<br>
They’re soaping over the windows in the Whitehouse<br>
And they’re sinking all their money into coal<br>
<br>
Where is Lee Harvey Oswald?<br>
When we’re shaking and afraid?<br>
We need a shadow in every window along the parade route<br>
To make ‘em wish that they’d never joined that motorcade<br>
<br>
Where is John Wilkes Booth when we need him?<br>
C’mon man and shake that broken leg<br>
That son of a bitch is up there in the balcony, man I can see ‘em<br>
John Wilkes Booth don’t make us beg<br>
John Wilkes Booth don’t make us beg<br>
John Wilkes Booth don’t make us beg</blockquote>

<h3>John Wilkes Booth</h3>
<blockquote>John Wilkes Booth was a southern man<br>
Son of an actor in Maryland<br>
Bound for fortune on a gas-lit stage<br>
Bound to die at a tender age<br>
<br>
Washington to Baltimore<br>
He played the bills and he slept with whores<br>
And he burned inside with a hatred deep<br>
For the man who caused the south to weep<br>
<br>
Young Abe Lincoln wasn't young no more<br>
Tired old man when he won the war<br>
And he dreamed at night of his death by the hand<br>
Of the bitter world and a faceless man<br>
And he saw his body in a ghastly dream<br>
Draped in black while his widow screamed<br>
Two silver dollars on his eyelids lay<br>
Abraham Lincoln has died today<br>
<br>
And they said there were five and they said there were ten<br>
Some say that there was never more than just one man<br>
Who would smile to see Mr. Lincoln dead<br>
In the name of God and Dixie<br>
In the name of God and Dixie Land<br>
<br>
John Wilkes Booth and his band of men<br>
They'd failed before, but would not again<br>
And Good Friday dawned with a fickle sun<br>
Then Booth declared the day had come<br>
<br>
And the word was passed and the guns were brought<br>
Down to Mary Sarrat's boarding house<br>
Sealed in a note, Booth named just four<br>
But would the gallows would swing with many more<br>
<br>
And they said there were five and they said there were ten<br>
Some say that there was never more than just one man<br>
Who would smile to see Mr. Lincoln dead<br>
In the name of God and Dixie<br>
In the name of God and Dixie Land<br>
<br>
John Wilkes Booth went to his grave<br>
With a bullet in his neck and a broken leg<br>
A patriot and his fantasy<br>
Of redemption, grace, and bravery<br>
<br>
And those who were hanged and those who spent<br>
Their lives behind a jailer's fence<br>
Only Booth could have proved them free<br>
Of the taint of the conspiracy<br>
<br>
For they said there were five and they said there were ten<br>
Some say that there was never more than just one man<br>
Who would smile to see Mr. Lincoln dead<br>
In the name of God and Dixie<br>
In the name of God and Dixie Land<br>
In the name of God and Dixie<br>
In the name of God and Dixie Land</blockquote>

<h3>Kennesaw Line</h3>
<blockquote>This song was originally written by Floridian Don Oja-Dunaway in the 1970s and first recorded by country singer Gamble Rogers.  It's now most widely remembered for Claire Lynch's two versions, one with Front Porch String Band and the other as a solo project.  Oja-Dunaway apparently released an entire Civil War concept album circa 1989 called Kennesaw, but I've been unable to find much more about this.<br>

I am but a simple man, I've got no command of the written word<br>
I can only try and tell you the things I′ve seen and heard<br>
Listen to the picture forever etched on my mind<br>
The day that hell broke loose just north of Marietta all along the Kennesaw line<br>
The day that hell broke loose just north of Marietta<br>
<br>
Oh, the sun rose high above us that morning on a clear and cloudless day<br>
A peckerwood tapped on the tree that would soon be shot away<br>
Well, the heat blistered down through the leaves on the trees, the air seemed hot enough to catch fire<br>
The heavens seemed to be made of brass as the sun rose higher and higher<br>
<br>
Everything got real still and quiet, my old mess mate, Walter Hood<br>
Said, "I believe them boys down there they're up to something, you know it ain′t no thing good"<br>
Well the storm broke and swept down on us, rumbled through the hills<br>
Walter sighed and dropped his rifle, he said something to me about whippoorwills<br>
<br>
"Sammy, can't you hear 'em singing, singing for you and me<br>
And all the Maury Grays carry me back to Tennessee<br>
God bless the First and the Twenty-seventh, The Grand Rock City Guard<br>
Nobody every told me, oh, that dying would be so hard"<br>
<br>
"Sammy, I think I′ve been hurted real bad, ain′t this a hell of a day<br>
Best go and leave me be now, I think I need some time to pray<br>
Well, you know how bad I been wanting to go home, I couldn't see rightly how<br>
Oh, Colonel Field ain′t gonna have a choice this time, I think I'm gonna get my furlough now"<br>
<br>
Oh, don′t you tell me that you can't you hear 'em singing for you and me<br>
Oh, and all the Maury Grays, oh, carry me back to Tennessee<br>
Tennessee<br>
<br>
I told you all I′m a simple man, I've got no command of the written word<br>
I can only try and tell you the things that I′ve seen and heard<br>
Listen to the picture forever etched upon my mind<br>
The day that hell broke loose just north of Marietta all along the Kennesaw line<br>
The day that hell broke loose just north of Marietta all along the Kennesaw line<br>
<br>
Well I wish I was in the land of cotton<br>
Old times there are not forgotten<br>
Look away, Dixie Land<br>
<br>
The day that hell broke loose just north of Marietta all along the Kennesaw line<br>
The day that hell broke loose just north of Marietta all along the Kennesaw line</blockquote>

<h3>The Lady In Gray</h3>
<blockquote>“With so much heartache and loneliness in its past, it is no wonder that Camp Chase cemetery has witnessed a long history of strange occurrences.” – Dr. Von Zuko, author<br>
<br>
In Columbus, Ohio, Camp Chase served as a Confederate prison camp where the lives of over 2000 soldiers were ended by disease and malnutrition from the notoriously poor conditions. The majority of these men were buried in the prison cemetery. According to legend, the spirit of a young woman in a gray traveling dress haunts the cemetery, pausing to cry over the grave of the Unknown Soldier and marker number 223, belonging to Benjamin F. Allen of the 50th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, Company D. To this day, the mournful weeping of the Lady in Gray can be heard at night behind the locked iron cemetery gates, and fresh flowers mysteriously appear on the tombstone of her lost love, Benjamin.<br>
<br>
In one dark prison in a small Ohio town<br>
Two thousand Rebs were laid to rest in Yankee ground<br>
With their children, wives and mother's miles away<br>
No one would weep or bring fresh flowers to their graves<br>
<br>
Until one lonely grieving girl in Tennessee<br>
Who missed the man whose bride she'd never be<br>
Journeyed north to mourn him in her dress of gray<br>
And be close to where her only true love lay<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And the Lady in Gray still mournfully cries<br>
At stone 233 where her Benjamin lies<br>
With flowers and tears she grieves to this day<br>
For the soldier who loved the Lady in Gray<br>
<br>
She lived close to that graveyard 'til she died<br>
Spending many hours there at Benjamin's side<br>
And for two thousand lonely soldiers lying there<br>
She never failed to weep or bow her head in prayer<br>
<br>
Now fragrant flowers often suddenly appear<br>
On unmarked stones when there is nobody there<br>
And on moonlit nights on stone 233<br>
A ghostly figure dressed in gray can still be seen<br>
<br>
CHORUS
<br>
For the soldier who loved the Lady in Gray</blockquote>

<h3>Last Day at Gettysburg</h3>
<blockquote>The gray smoke from the battle<br>
Rollin' over the hill<br>
The fires, the dead, the dying<br>
Are in my memory ever still<br>
<br>
Oh, can't you hear<br>
Hear that angel band<br>
Singing, "Come home, soldier<br>
To the Promised Land."<br>
<br>
Longstreet, he stole away and cried<br>
When Lee gave him the orders to attack<br>
In his mind's eye he could see<br>
That most of his boys would not be back<br>
<br>
Oh, can't you hear<br>
Hear that angel band<br>
Singing, "Come home, soldier<br>
To the Promised Land."<br>
<br>
Willy Johnson and me<br>
Rebel soldiers both from Tennessee<br>
Willy, he's lyin' by my side<br>
Spoke these words to me, and then he died<br>
<br>
Oh, can't you hear<br>
Hear that angel band<br>
Singing, "Come home, soldier,<br>
To the Promised Land."</blockquote>

<h3>Last Day At Vicksburg</h3>
<blockquote>“Vicksburg is the key. The war can never be brought to a close until the key is in our pocket,” – President Abraham Lincoln<br>
<br>
“Vicksburg is the nail head that holds the South’s two halves together.” – Confederate President Jefferson Davis.<br>
<br>
Judging from the above quotes, Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis both knew the extreme importance of the city of Vicksburg. The Siege of Vicksburg lasted from May 18th to July 4th. Union General Grant and his Army of Tennessee attacked the fortified city of Vicksburg, Mississippi held by Lt. General John Pemberton and the Army of Vicksburg. The surrender of the city on July 4, 1863 gave the Union complete control of the Mississippi River, and, combined with General Lee’s defeat at Gettysburg the previous day, is considered a turning point in the war. Private Andrew Jackson Andrews was a proud member of the 31st Alabama Infantry. He survived many days of starvation and fighting. He was hospitalized before July 4th and was not on the battlefield the day of the surrender. He passed away on July 9, 1863 in an army hospital from some sort of infection. The family never knew whether he was shot or not. His wife Sarah was given his straight razor, case and strop, items that have been passed down through the family for generations. It’s now in the hands of his great-great grandson, co-writer Terry Foust.<br>
<br>
In 1863, on the ninth day of July<br>
In the Mississippi Delta, my great-great grandpa died<br>
Andrew Jackson Andrews stood and faced the call<br>
In the War Between the States where so many men would fall<br>
<br>
In Talladega County, in March of '62<br>
The time had come to join the fight against the Union Blue<br>
Alabama's 31st stood eleven hundred strong<br>
An infantry that fought with pride to defend their Southern home<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
His last day at Vicksburg, he looked battle-worn<br>
His suit of gray was faded, dirty, stained, and torn<br>
He'd never fired a single shot that final July day<br>
His last day at Vicksburg, they carried him away<br>
<br>
History tells a story of Vicksburg, under siege<br>
Forty-seven of dying from gunshot and disease<br>
They must of thought they'd walked straight through the gates of hell<br>
Down on the Mississippi, the day that Vicksburg fell<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
<i>(spoken) On a hot July morning, his young life slipped away<br>
'Cause his pride would not be challenged while he wore his suit of Gray</i><br>
<br>
His last day at Vicksburg, they carried him away</blockquote>

<h3>Last Letter Home</h3>
<blockquote>I have heard the cannons thundering at night<br>
And I cannot help but wondering why the rebel's cause is right<br>
And the morphine seems to do no good at all<br>
I would run all the way if I would not fall<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And I dreamed of a rose in a Spanish garden<br>
And I kissed you as I placed it in your hair<br>
If I'm ever on my feet again, I will<br>
I will run all the way just to meet you there<br>
<br>
Joined the Southern cavalry for fun<br>
I have rode a thousand horses, always had a way with a gun<br>
Now I'm among the horseless riders lying still<br>
Swallowed up by the cause on the hero's hill<br>
<br>
CHORUS (x2)</blockquote>

<h3>The Last Time</h3>
<blockquote>Momma made my uniform, sewed a stripe on the shoulder<br>
Poppa wanted my company flag: "Bring it back when it's over"<br>
Jenny came to say goodbye and she said would wait for me<br>
On the stallion I set out leaving Tennessee<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
"This is the last time you'll see Jenny"<br>
That's what the cottonwoods keep singing to me<br>
"Cause the last time you'll see Jenny<br>
Will be the last time you see Tennessee"<br>
<br>
I took her by the hand, it was last September<br>
My Jenny made that day one I'd remember<br>
I promised to return soon after victory<br>
Down the road I waved her by joining Robert E. Lee<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I held her close to me as we lay by the river<br>
And now I'm going to see the baby I gived her<br>
Momma made my uniform that I wore so gallantly<br>
"Poppa, I'm sorry your flag's wrapped all around me"<br>
<br>
CHORUS </blockquote>

<h3>Leaving This Lonesome Land</h3>
<blockquote>My calloused hands, they dig the hole<br>
Master's field is full of souls<br>
Cato lying the read oak tree<br>
Heart gave out at sity three<br>
<br>
Cato dropped his hoe and fell<br>
Never made it to the evening bell<br>
<br>
Never made a break to run<br>
Now I dig his grave in the Asheville sun<br>
<br>
The need the fields at the end of day<br>
To bid farewell and sing and pray<br>
<br>
We lay him down in a wicker tomb<br>
Mh-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm<br>
<br>
Place a stone above his head<br>
On mark for the slave that's dead<br>
<br>
Circle the grave and lay the white shells<br>
And Cato leaves this earthly hell<br>
<br>
Silent summer evening tolls<br>
For the lost plantation souls<br>
<br>
From whip and chains I took flight<br>
I lit out one moonless night<br>
<br>
Smell of blood still in the air<br>
Killed him dead, I'll say no prayer<br>
<br>
Pattyroller lost my trail<br>
Dig your graves, I ain't for sale<br>
<br>
Heading for the Union lines<br>
Who lead me through the lonesome pines</blockquote>

<h3>Lee's Command</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/12/mode/2up?q=brigade"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
Every hundred years or so, time can count on its hand<br>
Godly and worldly men who lead us and command<br>
Remember rebel Southland's cry and bid for able fame<br>
Called for a man, Robert E. Lee, to keep and call its name<br>
<br>
He put his faith and forces, then, and greater deeds to come<br>
In Longstreet, Jackson, and Hood, great ones to mention some<br>
And Traveller, his great white horse, Light Horse Harry reminds<br>
Of revolutionary fame in peace and warring kinds<br>
<br>
He drove McClellan out of Richmand, Pope out of Bull Run's hell<br>
Beat Hooker at Chancellorsville, lost Jackson to a southern shell<br>
His ragged and tired army, lacking numbers and supplies<br>
Gave up at Appomattox, surrendered dignity with sighs<br>
<br>
Of different and finer metal, cast was he, grandeur herald<br>
Apart and superior to the worthy of the world<br>
Through the hard pages of time his name stands aloft, alone<br>
His Confederacy lost the Civil War but his greatness forever's sown</blockquote>

<h3>Legend of the Rebel Soldier</h3>
<blockquote>In a dreary Yankee prison where a revel soldier lay<br>
By his side there stood a preacher Ere his soul should pass away<br>
And he faintly whispered: “Parson” as he clutched him by the hand<br>
Oh Parson, tell me quickly, Will my sould pass through the southland?<br>
<br>
Will my soul pass through the Southland, through old Virginia grand<br>
Will i see the hills of Georgia and the green fields of Alabam?<br>
Will i see that little churchhouse, where i pledged my heart and hand<br>
Oh Parson, tell me quickly, will my soul pass thorugh the Southland?<br>
<br>
Was for loving dear old Dixie, in this dreary cell I lie<br>
Was for loving dear old Dixie, in this northern state i die<br>
Will you see my littl daughter, wil you make her understand<br>
Oh Parson, tell my quickly, will my soul pass through the Southland?<br>
<br>
Then the Rebel soldier died.</blockquote>

<h3>The Legend Of Jennie Wade</h3>
<blockquote>“If there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath. And as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again.” -Sullivan Ballou in a letter to his wife.<br>
<br>
Jennie Wade lived in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with her husband and childhood sweetheart Johnston “Jack” Skelly, until Jack left to fight for the Union in the 87th Pennsylvania Infantry. He was injured in the Battle of Winchester and taken to a nearby hospital where he ran into a childhood friend fighting for the South, Wesley Culp. He gave Wesley a letter to take to Jennie if he ever was in Gettysburg again, not knowing that two weeks later, Wesley would be there along with the entire Army of Northern Virginia. Before he was able to deliver the message, Wesley was mortally wounded, and his body never identified. Meanwhile, Jennie did her part for the Union baking bread for the soldiers until a stray bullet traveled through the kitchen door and killed her instantly. She never knew the fate of her friend Wesley or her dear Jack. Jennie was the only civilian killed during the Battle of Gettysburg.<br>
<br>
Jennie Wade was in the middle of a town tore all apart<br>
Waiting for a true love who would always have her heart<br>
Jack was wounded in Virginia where a rebel shot him down<br>
His dying wish to send a letter back to her in his hometown<br>
<br>
He found comfort in a childhood friend who'd joined the Southern cause<br>
He was ordered on to Gettysburg to hold the Union soldiers off<br>
Promised Jack he’d deliver his last words to Jennie's hand<br>
But on a hill above that little town he died making a stand<br>
<br>
Now Jennie Wade still lived with hope in Gettysburg<br>
Waiting for the soldier who was never coming home to her<br>
She never knew her boy in Blue would not come back<br>
Cause Jack's letter lay lost in a fallen Rebel's sack<br>
<br>
Though some wore Blue and some wore Gray, each night they were in her prayers<br>
And she kept the bread a-baking so they'd not die hungry there<br>
'Til a stray sharp shooter's blast found her kitchen door<br>
She was gone before she knew what hit her, gone forever more<br>
<br>
Now Jennie Wade still haunts the streets of Gettysburg<br>
Waiting for the soldier who was never coming home to her<br>
She'll never know those loving words from her sweet Jack<br>
Cause Jack's letter lay lost in a fallen Rebel's sack<br>
<br>
Now Jennie Wade still haunts the streets of Gettysburg<br>
Waiting for the soldier who was never coming home to her<br>
She'll never know those loving words from her sweet Jack<br>
Cause Jack's letter lay lost in a fallen Rebel's sack</blockquote>

<h3>Lincoln's Funeral Train</h3>
<blockquote>On the twenty-first of April<br>
Eighteen and sixty-five<br>
The Three-Thirty-One left Washington<br>
For Lincoln's last train ride<br>
<br>
Cannons boomed, the bonfires burned<br>
The evergreens wore grey<br>
Three-Thirty-One, in the morning sun<br>
The hearse, that journey made<br>
<br>
See that train comin', boys, rollin' down Main<br>
Draped in black, she won't be back; it's Lincoln's funeral train<br>
With a portrait of a martyred man, shot down by a traitor<br>
Now toll the bell and bid farewell to the Great Emancipator<br>
<br>
And on the locomotive front<br>
His picture adorning<br>
In the oil lamps' gleaming yellow light<br>
Rumbling on `til morning<br>
<br>
The engine, Nashville Number Fifteen<br>
With her black flags flying<br>
Ran from Cleveland to Springfield<br>
Past the mourners, crying<br>
<br>
See that train comin', boys, rollin' down Main<br>
Draped in black, she won't be back; it's Lincoln's funeral train<br>
With a portrait of a martyred man, shot down by a traitor<br>
Now toll the bell and bid farewell to the Great Emancipator<br>
<br>
Crowds jammed the streets for a final look<br>
At the great man who had stood<br>
At the country's helm, through the bitter war<br>
That seemed of little good<br>
<br>
Felled by the bullet of John Wilkes Booth<br>
As the battle died away<br>
His guiding spirit to reconciled<br>
By absence brought dismay<br>
<br>
See that train comin', boys, rollin' down Main<br>
Draped in black, she won't be back; it's Lincoln's funeral train<br>
With a portrait of a martyred man, shot down by a traitor<br>
Now toll the bell and bid farewell to the Great Emancipator<br>
Now toll the bell and bid farewell to the Great Emancipator</blockquote>

<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
Mandy play your mandolin<br>
Oh, for your soldier boy<br>
While I'm still at home<br>
Play it softly all night long<br>
In a short while I'll be gone<br>
Mandy, play for me your song<br>
<br>
When I left for Tennessee<br>
With Forrest's cavalry<br>
So many fights I've seen<br>
But in my mind I'd always hear<br>
Above the battle's din<br>
You playing on your mandolin<br>
<br>
Every fight, we'd try to win<br>
Woah, we fought through thick and thin<br>
We did our very best<br>
Now a bullet's broken me<br>
No more fightin' will I see<br>
Now I'm back at home<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Mandy, please, dry your tears<br>
Don't let me see you cry<br>
I wanna see you smile<br>
Just one more time then I'll be gone<br>
But I won't go alone<br>
I'll always have your song<br>
<br>
Mandy, turn the lamp down low<br>
One more song then I must go<br>
Play it soft and slow<br>
For it's the last song that I'll hear<br>
Before my crown I'll win<br>
Mandy, play your mandolin<br>

<h3>A Mother's Prayer</h3>
<blockquote>A Civil War folktale shared by Wilma's family from the hills of Webster County, West Virginia tells of an elderly mother whose only son left her alone to join the Confederate Army. Before the war ended, the son was killed and shortly after receiving the news of his death, the broken-hearted mother also died. "A mother's Prayer", written and sung by Wilma, shares the love, loneliness and despair of this elderly mother.<br>
<br>
An old gray haired lady lay down to sleep<br>
With thoughts of her only son<br>
So far away in an awful war<br>
His duty to be done<br>
<br>
When he was just eight, they'd each made a vow<br>
When his father went away<br>
To care for each other through life here on earth<br>
A pledge they had kept till this day<br>
<br>
Theirs was a bond of love so strong<br>
That parting caused great pain<br>
She'd prayed each day for her loving son<br>
That he'd come home again<br>
<br>
In her dream he walked up the old home path<br>
As he'd done in his days as a lad<br>
Dear Mother he said, we'll meet again soon<br>
Don't worry or be sad<br>
<br>
And holding her hand and kissing her brow<br>
He slowly faded away<br>
On waking she knew she would see him no more<br>
And the sad news came that day<br>
<br>
Dear Lord I have no one left on this earth<br>
The heartbroken mother cried<br>
And clutching his picture to her breast<br>
She bowed her head and died<br>
<br>
Now Mother and Son are together once more<br>
In a land that's always day<br>
She in a homespun gingham dress<br>
And he in rebel gray<br></blockquote>

<h3>Murderers On the Cumberland Plateau</h3>
<blockquote><i>Murderers On The Cumberland Plateau</i> was written after having read Harry Caudill's book <i>Night Comes To The Cumberlands</i>. We were fascinated by his descriptions of how many family feuds started and the relationship between many of the feuds and the Civil War. The first time we ever sang the song was at the Down Home in Johnson City. After our last act a woman from the audience came up to us and said that her great-grandmother had gone through an experience similar to that of the woman in the song. So the song is real to at least one person. - Robin Williams (<a href="https://archive.org/details/now-then-1985-02-03_202105/page/22/"><i>Now and Then</i>, Vol. 2, Issue 3 (1985)</a>, p. 22<br></blockquote>
<br>
The oak and poplar trees grew tall around our mountain farm<br>
With corn in the fields and tobacco in the barn<br>
The word came up from Pikeville, cross the ridges to our door<br>
That men was dressed in blue and gray and headed off to war<br>
Our days of living good grew short and little did we know<br>
We'd be driven out by murderers on the Cumberland Plateau<br>
<br>
Shiloh took a rebel boy and Johnson was his name<br>
His Pa called us Unionists and he held us to blame<br>
They caught my husband by the spring and they shot him from behind<br>
Leaving nothing but Hell's fury burning in this heart of mine<br>
I hid my babies in the woods and I kept their crying low<br>
No one could stop those murderers on the Cumberland Plateau<br>
<br>
They burned the house and the fields, they stole the cattle and the swine<br>
Their drunken laughter ridiculed my darling who lay dying<br>
No one was there to hear us as we sang our bitter tune<br>
Of broken-hearted paupers on the wretched road to ruin<br>
So we headed off the mountains to the settlements below<br>
Driven out by murderers on the Cumberland Plateau<br>
<br>
I'm sunburnt and I'm dirty and I'm mired in poverty<br>
And the memory of a distant grave is all that carries me<br>
My cheeks turned white with rage, my eyes are flooded fury red<br>
When I tell my sons the names of the men who shot their father dead<br>
Oh, I can see it, yes, their unforgiving eyes do show<br>
They won't forget those murderers on the Cumberland Plateau<br>
<br>
Oh, dread disease and famine, please don't take my sons<br>
I'll need 'em soon as they have strength enough to hold a gun<br>
'Cause we'll be going back as sure as this world turns around<br>
And the hollows, creeks and snags will ring with the bloody battle sounds<br>
Back up to Kentucky where the oak and poplar grow<br>
Back to slay those murderers on the Cumberland Plateau<br>

Back up to Kentucky where the oak and poplar grow<br>
Back to slay those murderers on the Cumberland Plateau<br></blockquote>

<h3>My Black Bird Has Gone</h3>
<blockquote>Mr. Driftwood: "My Blackbird is Gone," a Civil War Song that the listener will have to interpret for himself. It might be a white boy or a white girl singing about a black mammy that he might have had. It could be a black boy singing about his sweetheart that's gone. Well, as Alan Lomax says, you have to interpret this song for yourself."<br>
<br>
She had the soul of an angel<br>
She had a heart that was true<br>
Her lips were sweet as the hummingbird's mouth<br>
All filled with the sweet honeydew<br>
<br>
She taught me how to be humble<br>
She taught me how to pray<br>
I thought I would die when she said goodbye<br>
And they carried my blackbird away<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
My blackbird is gone<br>
My blackbird is gone<br>
My blackbird is gone away<br>
They came with a chain<br>
They called her sweet name<br>
And they carried my blackbird away<br>
<br>
List to the roar of the cannons<br>
Look at the battle array<br>
It's all because of the tears that I shed<br>
When they carried my blackbird away<br>
<br>
Angels a-singing in heaven<br>
Hushed their sweet songs when they heard<br>
The cries of my heart<br>
When they tore me apart<br>
From the arms of my pretty blackbird<br>
<br>
My blackbird is gone<br>
My blackbird is gone<br>
My blackbird is gone away<br>
They came with a chain<br>
They called her sweet name<br>
And they carried my blackbird away<br>
<br>
My blackbird is gone<br>
My blackbird is gone<br>
I'll never forget the sad day<br>
They came with a chain<br>
They called her sweet name<br>
And they carried my blackbird away.</blockquote>

<h3>My Brother Paul and Me</h3>
<blockquote>I am from Virginia, my brother Paul and me<br>
Paul became a soldier in Virginia's infantry<br>
Soon I will be going north to join the war<br>
A band of soldiers waits for me up in Baltimore<br>
<br>
When I arrived in Maryland, the Union line was thin<br>
We took to the higher ground defending Washington<br>
We marched to Antietam in the fall of '62<br>
That's where I saw twelve thousand dead dressed in Union blue<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
On and on they march us down a never-ending line<br>
To the battlefield and lead us to the fight<br>
I am from Virginia and I'll fight the rebel's cause<br>
But I'll die before I fight my brother Paul<br>
<br>
Paul, I hope this letter finds you doing well<br>
I am camped near Gettysburg on Little Roundtop Hill<br>
The battle starts tomorrow, they say it means the war<br>
That we hold all the higher ground, the South will be destroyed<br>
<br>
The cannon starts to fire as the rebels form their lines<br>
I can see Virginia's flag marching slowly into sight<br>
But once I feel like running like a coward from the fight<br>
I'd rather face dishonor than to have to take Paul's life<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
The battle's finally over, somehow I have survived<br>
Without a single round of lead from my rifle being fired<br>
And Paul, I pray from this field today you'll walk away<br>
We'll march back to Virginia, me in blue, you in gray<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I am from Virginia, my brother Paul and me</blockquote>

<h3>(My Mammy's Miss America) My Daddy's Uncle Sam</h3>
<blockquote>I started out of Jamestown young and fancy free<br>
I went through old Virginia and the hills of Tennessee<br>
I met the French and Indians and we swapped a little lead<br>
They asked about my pedigree and this is what I said<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I'm just a good old country boy, that's just what I am<br>
My mammy's Miss America and my daddy's Uncle Sam<br>
<br>
I built a hundred campfires beneath that Southern moon<br>
Then I went to old Kentucky with my buddy Daniel Boone<br>
When the settlers crossed the mountains and squatted close to me<br>
I crossed the Mississippi and the mighty Missouri<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
'Twas on the lone prairie when my horse lay down and died<br>
So I gelded a big buffalo and I broke him out to ride<br>
The boys in California, oh, they gave a big hooray<br>
Their voices shook the mountains every time they heard me say<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I traveled with Kit Carson from Montan' to Mexico<br>
'Twas me that gave Bill Cody the name of Buffalo<br>
I was standing with my general when he shook with Robert Lee<br>
I'll be right there the next time my country calls for me<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
I've helped to raise my country from the valley to the sky<br>
I'm not ashamed to live a while and I'm not afraid to die<br>
I've been this wide world over and I stand right here to say<br>
The place I love the best is in the good ol' USA<br>

<h3>My Sittin' Window</h3>
<blockquote>At my sitting window<br>
I see people walking by<br>
Clouds up in the sky<br>
At the mercy of the wind<br>
At my sitting window<br>
I see a young boy on his bike<br>
I always wave when he rides by<br>
And pops a wheelie now and then<br>
He reminds me of a lad I used to know<br>
So long ago<br>
At my sitting window<br>
I see a couple and a moving van<br>
With some boxes in their hands<br>
Guess that old house finally sold<br>
They act just like two fools I knew back when<br>
Takes me back again<br>
<br>
CHORUS (x2)<br>
And no one knows I'm here<br>
And no one knows my name<br>
I lived in this house for years<br>
I hide behind this pane<br>
And this old rocking chair<br>
Somehow became my tomb<br>
And they wonder why it stays cold in this room<br>
<br>
At my sitting window<br>
I still see that Union flag<br>
Feel that hot lead in my back<br>
Turn the snow red on the ground<br>
At my sitting window<br>
I guess I'll always stay 18<br>
And Clara's still the girl for me<br>
But I never got to tell her so<br>
And she hummed Dixie as she watched them lay me down<br>
And every evening I still hear those cannons sound<br>
At my sitting window</blockquote>

<h3>Nights On The Tennessee</h3>
<blockquote>I remember when we wed at our home on the Tennessee<br>
Moonlit walks on the river road, holding hands, just you and me<br>
And sure as that old river rolled we thought there'd always be<br>
Nights just like those nights on the Tennessee<br>
<br>
War sent me away to Georgia in the fall of '63<br>
Always on our guard, fighting so desperately<br>
But tonight the guns are quiet and the stillness reminds me<br>
Of nights just like those nights on the Tennessee<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
So I'll think of you and how things used to be<br>
And I'll think about how happy you made me<br>
Around our home before the war, we thought there'd always be<br>
Nights just like those nights on the Tennessee<br>
<br>
Oh, and if I get back home and you're still there for me<br>
We'll share nights like those on the Tennessee<br>

CHORUS<br>

Oh, and if I get back home and you're still there for me<br>
Hope there's nights just like those on the Tennessee</blockquote>

<h3>Northern Prison Blues</h3>
<blockquote>Elmira Prison was in existence for about one year toward the end of the Civil War, yet 2,933 Southern soldiers, of the 12,122 that were imprisoned, died there. Upon their release, an eye witness to the survivors related, "I speak in all reverence when I say that I do not believe such a spectacle was ever seen on earth... On they came, a ghastly tide with skeleton bones, lusterless eyes, brains bereft of but one thought, and hearts purged of but one feeling, the thought of freedom, the love of home." (Elmira Prison web site). The song "Northern Prison Blues" speaks of the prisoner's desire to be free and to go home, the abiding thought that kept them going in the face of dire, dire circumstances, perhaps even living, more than any other influence.<br>
<br>
I'm in prison in Elmira where the chilly winds do blow<br>
On the banks of Chemung River and I'm feeling mighty low<br>
I've been here in this prison since eighteen sixty four<br>
Wondering if I'll ever see the dear old South once more<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
I've got the northern prison blues<br>
Wishing I was home and thinking dear of you<br>
Just waiting for this old Civil War to end<br>
So I can once again be free and go back home again<br>
<br>
We were fighting down near Richmond when a bullet brought me down<br>
I could not get away so I lay there on the ground<br>
The Yankees finally found me and carried me away<br>
And I've been here in this prison since that awful day<br>
<br>
Life here in this prison is a struggle at it's best<br>
Many men have died here their souls have gone to rest<br>
Every day they call the roll there're less of us to count<br>
I'm determined I'll survive and someday I'll get out<br>

<h3>Not A Word of That Be Said</h3>

Let me see the glorious sun<br>

Is the battle lost or won?<br>

Who sent to me that fatal dart<br>
Brother fighting 'gainst brother<br>
'Tis well, 'tis well that this we part<br>

You may meet him on the field<br>
Could you raise your arm and smite him?<br>
Could you bid your father yield?<br>

Taught the infant prayers we said<br>
Brother, take from me this warning<br>
I'll soon be numbered with the dead<br>

Do you ever think of Mother<br>
In our home within the glen<br>
Watching, praying for her children<br>

Keep the secret, from this one*<br>

<h3>O Captain! My Captain!</h3>
<blockquote>O captain, my captain, our fearful trip is done<br>
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won<br>
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting<br>
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring<br>
<br>
But heart! heart! heart!<br>
O the bleeding drops of red<br>
Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>
Fallen cold and dead<br>
<br>
O captain, my captain, rise up and hear the bells<br>
Rise up -- for you the flag is flung -- for you the bugle trills<br>
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths -- for you the shores a-crowding<br>
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning<br>
<br>
Here captain, dear father<br>
This arm beneath your head<br>
It is some dream that on the deck<br>
You've fallen cold and dead<br>
<br>
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still<br>
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will<br>
The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done<br>
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won<br>
<br>
Exult, o shores, and ring, o bells<br>
But I, with mournful tread<br>
Walk the deck my captain lies<br>
Fallen, cold, and dead<br>
<br>
Exult, o shores, and ring, o bells<br>
But I, with mournful tread<br>
Walk the deck my captain lies<br>
Fallen, cold, and dead</blockquote>

<h3>Oh Florie</h3>
<blockquote>My heart it broke in one little bits and I tell you all what for<br>
My sweetheart was a very patriotic girl and she runs me off with the war<br>
I fight for her the battle of the flag as brave as ever I can<br>
But a long time ago she nixes me and runs off with another man<br>
<br>
CHORUS:<br>
Oh, Florie (Florie, Florie), what makes you so unkind?<br>
You went with Hans to Germany and left poor Schnapps behind<br>
<br>
We marched all day and the rain come down just like old Noah's flood<br>
I sleeps all night with my head on a rock and my feet all stuck in the mud<br>
The nightmare come and I cotch him by the tail; I dreams I sleep with a ghost<br>
Next day I was frozen in the mud just like a barnyard goat<br>
<br>
They gives me hardtack bread to eat but likes to broke my jaw<br>
Sometimes I split him with an iron wedge and sometimes with a saw<br>
The beef he was so salty, Lot's wife killed him, I know<br>
And the general says they put him in the brine ten thousand years ago<br>
<br>
At last we takes a southern town and hold him for one year<br>
They puts red pepper in the sauerkraut and vinegar in the beer<br>
I meets a lady on the street as pretty as one could be<br>
I tries to kiss her rebel lips and hoch! she spit on me!</blockquote>

<h3>Old Elijah</h3>
<blockquote>Elijah, oh, and Johnson with Jackson in the war<br>
He served his time in Caroline and the east Virginia shore<br>
And he'd seen enough of that rebel blood to drive any man insane<br>
Somebody'd mentioned Yankee, he'd just spit and cuss the name<br>
<br>
They called him Old Elijah from the day that he was born<br>
And he worked the wheel at the grinding mill sacking Carolina corn<br>
And his woman died with a stillborn child and left him there to raise<br>
His only living daughter with a sweet angelic face<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And he swore that he would love her<br>
And he swore that he would kill<br>
Any man who threatened danger<br>
To his angel, Sarah Jill<br>
<br>
One night as he lay sleeping he heard footsteps in the rain<br>
And he saw a shadow moving in the dim light of a flame<br>
And he swore it was the uniform of the Union man he'd dread<br>
So he fired out in his anger from the window as he said<br>
<br>
Your Union killed my brothers when they took their rebel stand<br>
Now I'm gonna spill your Yankee blood here on my Southern land<br>
And when the gun lay silent and all the words were said<br>
He ran to hide his daughter but he found an empty bed<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
He ran up toward the mill side where he'd seen the shadow go<br>
And he found the lamp still burning and there in the ember glow<br>
Lay a bloody woolen overcoat and a petticoat of lace<br>
And a lifeless body with a sweet angelic face<br>
<br>
The preacher and the family sadly bowed their heads to pray<br>
And with solemn words they sought the Lord beside a double grave<br>
Cause they found Elijah laying by her body in the dawn<br>
His finger on the trigger of the pistol he had drawn<br>
<br>

<h3>Old John Burns</h3>
<blockquote>“There’s my bullets, and here’s my powder horn, and I know how to use them.” -John Burns, from a letter by Colonel Callis of the 7th Wisconsin<br>
<br>
John Burns, a veteran of the War of 1812, was in his early seventies when he heard gunfire outside his home in the Cumberland Valley. Guessing correctly it was the Union army on its way to Gettysburg; he went out to meet them. With an old flint lock pistol in hand, John Burns sought out the commander of the Seventh Wisconsin Volunteers of the Old Iron Brigade and asked to be part of the regiment. Though he was told to stay in the back, Burns refused and joined the front lines. He was shot three times, but even that could not keep Old John Burns down. He tricked rebel soldiers into carrying an innocent old man home to his wife. John Burns was considered a true Union hero. He was visited by President Lincoln when he traveled to Gettysburg in 1863, and when Burns passed away the Iron Brigade decorated his grave in honor of his service.<br>
<br>
John L. Burns was older than the hills<br>
And a veteran of the War of 1812<br>
When Lincoln asked for Union volunteers<br>
He'd already served his country well<br>
<br>
That brave soul, in 1861<br>
Was the first in line to join the Union cause<br>
But they called him a man too old to serve<br>
They didn't see the fighting man he was<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Old John Burns, he was a tough old bird<br>
Born to hold a musket in his hands<br>
Old John Burns, he left them with these words<br>
"You haven't seen the last of this old man"
<br>
At Gettysburg in 1863<br>
Old John picked up his musket one more time<br>
When that war came to his Pennsylvania town<br>
He proved his worth there on the battle line<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
That old rifleman would stand and he would fight<br>
Right beside that brave Iron Brigade<br>
It took three Rebel guns to bring him down<br>
Yet death would have to come some other day<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
You haven't seen the last of this old man</blockquote>

<h3>A Picture Of Three Children</h3>
<blockquote>“…upon this picture his eyes, set in death, rested. The last object upon which the dying father looked was the image of his children…” -“Whose Father Was He?” The Philadelphia Inquirer Oct. 19, 1863<br>
<br>
In the October 19, 1863 edition of The Philadelphia Inquirer, an article entitled “Whose Father Was He?” described in detail a picture of three children, all under age ten, that was found clutched in the hand of an unknown soldier killed three months prior in the Battle of Gettysburg. Dr. J. Francis Bourns was determined to find the family. This type of photograph, called an ambrotype, could not be printed in newspapers, so the description was circulated far and wide until it was fatefully read by a woman in Portville, NY. Philinda Humiston recognized the picture of her children Franklin, Alice and Frederick, and knew then that her husband, Amos Humiston, would not be returning home from war.<br>
<br>
When that three day battle ended, one man in Blue was found<br>
With no name to tell his story as they laid him in the ground<br>
Just one more unknown soldier, but held tightly to his chest<br>
Was a picture of three children, dressed in their Sunday best<br>
<br>
They pried it from his fingers clutched tightly in his grasp<br>
Knowing it was the last thing he'd seen before he passed<br>
The story of that picture traveled farther north each day<br>
Where all the local papers described on their front page<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
A picture of three children in three little wooden chairs<br>
Two brothers and one sister, sweet faces and dark hair<br>
Three angels to one soldier whose name remains unknown<br>
A picture of three children whose father won't be coming home<br>
<br>
In New York, a wife and mother was waiting for some word<br>
From the father of her children, last seen in Gettysburg<br>
When she read about that picture found on a Union man<br>
And knew her husband, Amos, had held tightly in his hand<br>
<br>
CHORUS (... whose name was finally known... )<br>
<br>
It was a picture of three children, Amos won't be coming home</blockquote>

<h3>Poor Rebel Soldier</h3>
<blockquote>I’m a poor rebel soldier a long way from home<br>
Ain’t had me no loving since the day I’ve been gone<br>
Can’t find me no woman in this Yankee land<br>
There’s a place in old Dixie I know where I can<br>
<br>
Since I left old Georgia a long time ago<br>
We run Grant’s big army in the land where it snows<br>
The cold wind is blowing and freezing the rain<br>
But there’s hot blood still running through these rebel veins<br>
<br>
The call of the wild keeps howling to me<br>
From the mountains down yonder in old Tennessee<br>
Got a woman who’s waiting in old Knoxville town<br>
When night falls I’m going to be Tennessee bound<br>
<br>
I’m a poor rebel soldier and I’m going home<br>
Cause I don’t call it living when I’m living alone<br>
Come morning they’ll look but me they won’t find<br>
I’m going to be south of that old Dixie line</blockquote>

<h3>Powder Dry</h3>
<blockquote>Them Shelby boys they stayed down in those old woods<br>
Running for hours as long as they could<br>
Soldier was a game they played long into the night<br>
But little did John know back then it would be his life<br>
<br>
Now he's just a calvaryman crossing bloody streams<br>
Filled with Blue and Gray, where death is victory<br>
They'll march on, they'll kill on, no fear in his eyes<br>
Only to see again his sweet wife Angeline<br>
<br>
He cried Angeline, I see you my mind<br>
And my dear, I'm on my way<br>
Oh, Angeline, with that baby of mine<br>
On your hip, my kisses on your lips<br>
That's where I'm gonna stay<br>
Well they told us to pray every night and every day<br>
And this is mine<br>
God get me back to Angeline<br>
And keep my powder dry<br>
<br>
The last shot was fired, the war it was done<br>
John headed back to the house with his horse and his gun<br>
He felt so tormented with pain in his mind<br>
He knew she could heal him, the love of his life<br>
<br>
He reached that old hillside place he called home<br>
Only greeted with ashes and sorrow<br>
And he prayed to the Father, his dear he would not find<br>
A-laying in the doorway, his son and Angeline<br>
<br>
And he cried Angeline, now in Heaven you abide<br>
And my dear, I'm on my way<br>
Oh, Angeline, with that baby of mine<br>
On your hip, my kisses on your lips<br>
That's where I'm gonna stay<br>
Well they told us to pray every night and every day<br>
And this is mine<br>
God take me now to Angeline<br>
And keep my powder dry<br>
Oh, keep my powder dry<br>
So I can see the light<br>
Keep my powder dry<br>
So I can see the light<br>
<br>
Oh, Angeline, now in Heaven we abide<br>
And my dear, I fell my way<br>
Oh, Angeline with that baby of mine<br>
On your hip, my kisses on your lips<br>
Tis is where I'm gonna stay<br>
Well they told us to pray every night and every day<br>
And this was mine<br>
God get me back to Angeline<br>
And keep my powder dry</blockquote>

<h3>Providence Spring</h3>
<blockquote>“God smote the hillside and gave them drink” – Inscription at Providence Spring<br>
<br>
In November 1863, Confederate Captain Sidney Winder chose the village of Andersonville in Sumter County, Georgia as the location for a new prison for captured Union soldiers. The prison was completed in February of 1864, and by August there were over 33,000 Union soldiers enclosed in an area meant for 10,000 men. The stream that supplied the camp with water soon became polluted by human waste, and deaths from disease and gangrene rose, with up to 90 soldiers dying each day. In desperation, a group of soldiers began to pray for water. Soon, a storm broke out, and thunder roared, and where lightning struck the prison ground, a fountain of pure spring water erupted. Whether it was the prayer or construction of the prison that caused the underground water to well up, no one knows, but that clean water saved the lives of thousands of Union soldiers, and continues to flow to this day.<br>
<br>
Life was hell on earth in a deadly Georgia prison<br>
Where the stench of death could break the strongest soldier's will<br>
For those Union men the reaper showed no mercy<br>
For few survived the agony of Andersonville<br>
<br>
For thirty thousand men it was standing room only<br>
With no shelter from the burning sun or the pouring rain<br>
One wretched stockade creek, the only source of water<br>
Left union soldiers dying in misery and pain<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
'Til Providence Spring flowed like magic through that prison<br>
They drank their fill while listening to the rumbling waters sing<br>
In the face of deep despair, hope was finally there<br>
In those pure, healing waters of Providence Spring<br>
<br><br>
One day a storm cloud moved across the walls of that prison<br>
One loud clap of thunder roared and lightning struck the ground<br>
From that spot there flowed a pure and sparkling fountain<br>
That quenched the thirst of many till freedom came around<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
CHORUS (3rd line: In the face of deep despair, hope was finally there)<br>

In those pure, healing waters of Providence Spring</blockquote>

<h3>The Rebel and the Rose</h3>
<blockquote>There were many<br>
Came to call on dark-eyed Jenny<br>
Underneath that blood-red lantern in New Orleans<br>
French Quarter, trés gentille<br>
Make a man forget about what he don’t wanna feel<br>
Circumstances<br>
Make her wonder what the chance is<br>
He’ll still have her if he lives to see<br>
How his Alabama rose<br>
Had to close the mouth of poverty<br>
<br>
We’re all broken<br>

To the body, to the soul<br>
To the rebel and the rose<br>

Abijiah<br>
Stumbled over many miles<br>
Like all the southern boys he was runnin’ scared<br>
Unsure whether he<br>
Should follow the letter she sent toward the first of the year<br>
He reached the city<br>
Determined to leave if pity<br>
Was the only thing he read in her gaze anymore<br>
Would she want a man<br>
Who couldn’t hold her like he had before<br>
<br>
We’re all broken<br>
True love knows<br>
And it reaches out the healing hands of hope<br>
To the body, to the soul<br>
To the rebel and the rose<br>
<br>
Her arms around him, they stand<br>
Lookin’ on their promised land<br>
And thank the Lord for bringing forth<br>
From barren ground<br>
This crop of cotton and kids<br>
A whole lotta happiness<br>
They thought could never be found<br>
<br>
We’re all broken<br>
God only knows<br>
He reaches out the healing hands of hope<br>
To the body, to the soul<br>
To the rebel and the rose<br>
<br>
To the body, to the soul<br>
To the rebel and the rose</blockquote>

<h3>Rebel Hart</h3>
<blockquote>“A liberal reward is offered for information leading to the whereabouts and eventual capture of a Miss Nancy Hart, about 16 years of age, black hair, dark eyes, fair complexion. Considered to be comely in appearance, and known to be a Rebel guide and spy.” – Civil War warrant circulated throughout Western Virginia early in 1862<br>
<br>
Nancy Hart grew up on a small farm in the mountain districts of Roane County, Virginia. She was always known as the ‘rebel of the family,’ a moniker that proved apt when Nancy, unlike her Union soldier brothers, joined a band of pro-southern guerrillas known as the Moccasin Rangers in 1861. She could ride and shoot as well as the men, and she used her gender to lure unsuspecting Yankees into revealing information that she could take to Confederate Generals. Once, Nancy was recognized and captured in Summersville, but she seduced her guard and tricked him into giving her his rifle. She killed the guard and escaped, and came back a week later with 200 mounted infantry. Nancy managed to avoid the rope throughout the war, and ended her days in Greenbrier County with her husband Joshua. The south may have lost the war, but it seems the “Rebel Hart” came out a winner.<br>
<br>
Born to be a rebel with a rifle in her hands<br>
Nancy Hart could ride and shoot as good as any man<br>
At just 14 her young heart embraced the Southern way<br>
Another family divided between the Blue and Gray<br>
<br>
With rangers in Virginia, as a soldier and a spy<br>
A pretty country girl could pass right through those Union lines<br>
She gathered information that brought those Yankees down<br>
Until her reputation was spread for miles around<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
They called her Rebel Hart, and put a bounty on her head<br>
When she was finally caught, she charmed a guard and shot him dead<br>
Leaping out the window, a small shadow in the dark<br>
Escaping on a stolen horse, that girl called Rebel Hart<br>
<br>
She knew it wasn't over; there was more blood to be spilled<br>
As Nancy led her rebel troops straight back to Summersville<br>
She caught her captors by surprise as they wept and moaned<br>
Seems like this time Rebel Hart was taking prisoners of her own<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Escaping on a stolen horse, a girl called Rebel Hart</blockquote>

<h3>Rebel Raider</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/62/mode/2up?q=brigade"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
John Singleton Mosby broke away from his band<br>
Headed behind enemy lines, took everything in the land<br>
Bravely brought it back, more and more like a ghost<br>
Piled it where the Rebel men needed it bad and needed it most<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Sneaked in here, poked in there, a certain in and outer<br>
As Yankee bullets chased around, in stature he grew stouter<br>
<br>
With a sly look and a grin as wide as high<br>
Took everything from the North -- left Federals yelling to the sky<br>
Sneaked behind the Yankee camps, took their hay and their horses<br>
Took their guns and ammunition, took them to the southern forces<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Ran the gauntlet with his men, sometimes with, sometimes without<br>
Captured a general in his tent, took him south without a shout<br>
A wincing thorn he was in the side of Yankee vent<br>
Never stayed still very long, left trails of trouble wherever he went<br>
<br>
Worried was the fidgety North over his every thought and breath<br>
Daring deeds and warring work priced high his death<br>

<h3>Rebel Soldier</h3>
<blockquote>I came back from the Civil War, just 22 years old<br>
I done killed near 50 men, and now the devil owns my soul<br>
Well, I've always been a Christian man and that's not hard to tell<br>
But with all the killing that I've done, well I'll surely go to hell<br>
<br>
CHORUS
Well I am a rebel soldier, no, I'm not afraid to fight<br>
For the lives of the innocent and all my southern pride<br>
Well I am a rebel soldier, no I'm not afraid to die<br>
You may hang me in the morning but I'll haunt you in the night<br>
<br>
Me and my brothers went to war, I was the oldest of the three<br>
I was the only one who came home to a murdered family<br>
Well, the Yanks had burned my house down with my family inside<br>
And my dad got shot tryin to fight em off and they left me there to die<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Me and my friends got together to start a guerilla band<br>
To track down them sons of bitches that torched up all our land<br>
We left early in the morning on the 14th of July<br>
And by the 26th of the very same month we put 'em in the by and by<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Now I am a wanted outlaw, bounty hunter's on my trail<br>
There's a law man behind every tree, wants to put me in the jail<br>
Well, they cornered me in August of the very same year<br>
And by noon on the next I was hanging by rope with a grin from ear to ear<br>

Than the one you fought for and lost<br>
Could a man give more than his own life<br>

Fought til you couldn't fight no more<br>
In Chancellorsville you fell, a bullet in your side<br>

And a man this world had never seen<br>
Victory for you, they said could never be<br>
But you'll always be a winner to me<br>

<h3>Rebels Last Letter</h3>
<blockquote>[written by Canadian artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Cormier">J. P. Cormier</a>]<br>
<br>
My captain tells me, mother, that you're not long for this world<br>
And you want your son to say his last goodbye<br>
So I will write this letter til the early light of dawn<br>
'Fore we fire our guns and raise the Rebel flag up to the sky<br>
<br>
The battle now is over, and the page is stained with tears<br>
And my blood is wet upon a Yankee sword<br>
I can see the face of Jesus shining in my mind<br>
I know that I will leave this place and go on to my Lord<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I'll be waiting for you, mother, at the pearly gates on high<br>
Don't be afraid to leave this arthly veil of tears behind<br>
We'll live there with the angels in that city beyond the blue<br>
We'll be waiting, me and Jesus, for you<br>
<br>
I can hear the riders coming to take those who survived<br>
I can see the Lord reaching out His hand<br>
I know that they'll come looking but they'll find my soul has fled<br>
With a band of Rebel angels to that holy Promised Land<br>
<br>
CHORUS (x2)<br>
<br>
There'll be no wars a-raging in that city beyond the blue<br>
We'll be waiting, me and Jesus, for you</blockquote>

<h3>Rebel's Last Request</h3>
<blockquote>1863 was an awful place to be<br>
I never thought I'd make it out alive<br>
But a dying man's request helped me pass the rugged test<br>
And see the end in 1865<br>
<br>
He called me to his side and just before he died<br>
That rebel soldier made it clear to me<br>
That his one last desire before his soul, it did retire<br>
Was returning home and there forever be<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Take me back to the southland<br>
Mississippi is my home<br>
Let me rest with those green fields above me<br>
Nevermore will I roam<br>
<br>
So I dug a shallow grave, marked the place where he was laid<br>
By a nearby lonesome weeping willow tree<br>
And in case I lost my life or another took my knife<br>
I carved those final words he said to me<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Came 1865, and I'd made it out alive<br>
So I returned to fill his final plea<br>
But I found nobody there, just a feeling in the air<br>
And enchanted words upon the willow tree<br>
<br>
CHORUS (He's gone back ... &amp;c.)</blockquote>

<h3>Reflections Of Love</h3>
<blockquote>(see also: <a href="https://bluegrasstoday.com/the-story-behind-the-song-reflections-of-love/">The Story Behind the Song – Reflections of Love</a> by Richard Thompson in <i>Bluegrass Today</i>)<br>
<br>
In her gingham gown, flowing to the ground<br>
He placed fragrant daisies in her hair<br>
By the sweet gentle stream, together they dreamed<br>
Of their life and the wedding day to share<br>
<br>
Just a boy of seventeen filled with life, love, and dreams<br>
And the pride from the land where he was raised<br>
In his southern gray, prepared to go away<br>
He did vow to return to her someday<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And together they would walk through flowered meadow green<br>
Past the church where they'd have their wedding day<br>
In the twilight of the eve, down by the flowing stream<br>
They saw reflections of the sweet love they made<br>
<br>
As the time passed along, the war lingered on<br>
And many Southern sons never returned<br>
And she prayed to God above to watch over the man she loved<br>
For his loving arms her poor heart did yearn<br>
<br>
As he turned 21, a new had dawned<br>
The ragged men in gray laid down their guns<br>
With his spirits scarred at war, his gray coat old and torn<br>
His thoughts did return to his true love<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
He returned to the place where she pledged she would wait<br>
On that warm sunny day four years before<br>
But the sorrow filled the air when she found wasn't there<br>
And her hand he would never touch no more<br>
<br>
Her soul left the earth on the day she gave birth<br>
As a babe I came in this world alone<br>
Now it's just me and dad, and his memory's all we have<br>
Strolling by the little stream like long ago<br>
<br>
Now dad and I, we walk through the flowered meadow green<br>
Passed the grave where my dear sweet mother lay<br>
And each time he looks at me I know that he can see<br>
The reflections of the sweet love they made</blockquote>

<h3>Restless Spirit Wandering</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
Restless spirit wandering, come on home again<br>
Tell me about your days of old, wander back again<br>
You don't admit your life is taken, to your death not yet awakened<br>
Restless spirit wandering, come on home again<br>
<br>
Oglethorpe was around this place some hundred fifty years<br>
Since a Union bullet hit its mark and his teenaged heart it pierced<br>
Years ago a young girl lived here, she became his friend<br>
But when their family moved away their friendship had to end<br>
<br>
And when we bought this house the neighbors came and talked about him<br>
Though we've not heard or seen a thing, I hope he comes again<br>
I'd like to ask him lots of things, and hear the way he talks<br>
Describing local battle scenes on some slow morning walk<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
The room I write in used to be a two car garage<br>
A nineteen fifties chrome and fin and white wall tired montage<br>
Years later it became a church, and they moved an organ in<br>
And these walls would shake with holy songs and sermons against sin<br>
<br>
And I like to think this place was made for the kind of work I do<br>
And I'll try to be ready when the spirit comes back through<br>
I'll write it down and sort it out and make it fairly rhyme<br>
And marry it to the melody of highest flying kind<br>
<br>
I want to try to be a friend to souls that cannot rest<br>
I would not blame their anger, don't claim to know what's best<br>
But souls are all connected like the branches on a tree<br>
And things they see beyond the grave might help out you and me<br>
<br>
Restless spirit wandering, come on home again<br>
Tell me about your days of old, wander back again<br>
Tell me as you come and go, things that people need to know<br>
Restless spirit wandering, come on home again<br>
Don't admit your life is taken, to your death not yet awaken<br>
Restless spirit wandering, come on home again</blockquote>

<h3>Reverend Peter Tinsley</h3>
<blockquote>Most Civil War soldiers possessed a deep faith and trust in God to protect them during battles and illness. Both music and literature portray them as accepting death that lurked ahead in any battle believing that they had a home in Heaven. Like most units, the 28th Virginia had a chaplain who traveled with them, prayed with them, and often preached to them. Reverend Peter Tinsley served this role for the 28th Virginia and remained with them throughout the war. He was away from them only when he was captured and imprisoned after Pickett's Charge when he walked with them in that charge. Griffith Creasy spoke highly of him for his friendship and bravery. The song, "Reverend Peter Tinsley," tells about his actions and ideals, and the faith and trust the men of the 28th placed in him.<br>
<br>
In eighteen sixty one with our country torn apart<br>
Many lives were broken as well as many hearts<br>
we all needed comfort as on this path we trod<br>
We put our faith and trust in a man of God<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
Now Reverend Peter Tinsley would bring us to our knees<br>
To pray to the Lord to take care of our needs<br>
He'd walk with us in battle and pray with us at night<br>
And preach to us on Sunday to get our souls all right<br>
<br>
The Twenty Eighth Virginia depended on this man<br>
To pray before each battle with Bible in his hand<br>
He'd ask for our protection and forgiveness from the Lord<br>
He was our friend and chaplain throughout the Civil War<br>
<br>
with bullets flying round us, you'd see him standing there<br>
With his hand raised to the sky as if he was in prayer<br>
We put our very lives in the hand of the Lord<br>
And went about the business of fighting in this war<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
My thoughts had turned to dying the fear I could not hide<br>
He took me by the shoulder and walked by my side<br>
Said God will not forsake you and leave you all alone<br>
You must trust in God my son and be ready to go home<br>
<br>
His words of comfort gave me strength enough to move along<br>
My legs and steps grew steady and once again were strong<br>
I marched into the battle knowing that full well<br>
I had a cloak of Armour against their ball and shell<br>
<br>
Chorus</blockquote>

<h3>The River Man</h3>
<blockquote>“A more fearless creature never lived. He gloried in danger. He would go boldly over into the enemy’s camp and filch the fugitives to freedom.” – The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, written shortly after Parker’s death<br>
<br>
By the age of 8, John P. Parker had been ripped from his mother’s arms and forced to walk from his home in Virginia to Mobile, Alabama. He spent the next decade as a slave, working at an iron foundry where he showed a great aptitude for the work, and for invention. At 18, he had earned enough to buy his freedom from the Widow Ryder, and he moved north, where he married and settled on the banks of the Ohio River. He spent the rest of his life there in Ripley, Ohio, an iron worker by day and a conductor on the Underground Railroad by night. Risking constant danger, Parker carried hundreds of men, women, and children over the river to the freedom that lay on the other side. He continued fighting for justice until 1910, when he died in his bed surrounded by family as a free man.<br>
<br>
John P. Parker lived his life with one foot in the grave<br>
A white man was his father, his mother was a slave<br>
Living in the misery of slavery's painful grip<br>
His back came to know the bite of a cruel master's whip<br>
<br>
Bought and sold till the Widow Ryder -- well she made a deal<br>
To let him earn his freedom in a foundry in Mobile<br>
Then on the banks of the Ohio, the best iron man around<br>
Ran that river for the railroad's secret underground -- The River Man<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
River man was an iron master by daylight<br>
River man ran a secret freedom train by dark of night<br>
Those who came searching for the Promised Land<br>
Crossed that water with a helping hand from The River Man<br>
<br>
For fifteen years John put his freedom in harm's way<br>
He risked his life running that river more and more each day<br>
And with a thousand dollar bounty lying on his head<br>
He rescued many others from the life that he once led -- The River Man<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
The war between the states, well it finally came<br>
Men he saved from bondage joined the fight in freedom's name<br>
'Til the General Lee surrendered in 1865<br>
'Tween the foundry and the river, John led a double life -- The River Man<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
And those who came searching for the Promised Land<br>
Crossed that water with a helping hand from The River Man<br>
Whoa, The River Man<br>
The River Man</blockquote>

<h3>River Runs Red</h3>
<blockquote>The thirty-first day of December<br>
Three thousand dressed in blue and gray<br>
All sons of the heavenly father<br>
Lay in a watery grave<br>
<br>
And the river runs red<br>
The river runs red<br>
<br>
One shot woke the Tennessee morning<br>
Soon fire and smoke filled the sky<br>
Then rain came down with no warning<br>
As sorrow fell down from all sides<br>
<br>
The river runs red<br>
The river runs red<br>
No winners or losers<br>
When you count the dead<br>
We watch it roll by<br>
We all bow our heads<br>
The guns have gone silent<br>
But the river runs red<br>
<br>
Now Rogers was from Alabama<br>
And Thomas an old New York town<br>
But soon they would die like blood brothers<br>
In the stream where their souls would flow down<br>
<br>
The river runs red<br>
The river runs red<br>
No winners or losers<br>
When you count the dead<br>
We watch it roll by<br>
We all bow our heads<br>
The guns have gone silent<br>
But the river runs red<br>
<br>
Some say you could see red for miles<br>
And it flowed that way so many years<br>
Now the water looks clean and untainted<br>
But Stones River will never run clear<br>
<br>
The river runs red<br>
The river runs red<br>
No winners or losers<br>
When you count the dead<br>
We watch it roll by<br>
We all bow our heads<br>
The guns have gone silent<br>
But the river runs red</blockquote>

<h3>Safe Passage</h3>
<blockquote>A long, long time ago where Scotland meets the water<br>
They climbed onboard a schooner heading west<br>
For safe passage they did pray, with their sons and their daughters<br>
To a new world they hoped to be the best<br>
<br>
They rode the waves for weeks, into the mouth of the St. Lawrence<br>
And crawled off that boat in Montreal<br>
A generation lived and died between the river and the border<br>
But from the other side, there came a deadly call<br>
<br>
Far to the south, sabers had been rattled<br>
And it was said that any brave should take a stand<br>
Young men loved the fight, the pistol, and the saddle<br>
So he made his way on down to Dixieland<br>
<br>
And his mother prayed for him<br>
She prayed for his safe passage<br>
She prayed that he came barely back alive<br>
<br>
That boy returned old but he got his 40 acres<br>
And declared to him a lot from that low hill side<br>
He built my father's house and a barn when he was able<br>
Still standing tall to prove he was alive<br>
<br>
Our daddy told us young that he would be the last one<br>
To raise a living from that rocky land<br>
So across these many miles, back again too often<br>
My journey with a guitar in my hand<br>
<br>
My mother prays for me<br>
She prays for my safe passage<br>
She prays that I will make it back home alive</blockquote>

<h3>Sam Smith</h3>
<blockquote>Sam Smith was an old man by the time I first saw him<br>
Wild eyes and a wicked beard hanging from his chin<br>
I thought I'd seen the devil as a boy in ninety nine<br>
But Daddy called him the hermit from on the borderline<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
He said "They're never gonna take him back again and march him off to war<br>
Where gray-headed men in long wool coats assign their bloody chores<br>
They can look, but they won't find Sam Smith this time<br>
He's somewhere north of Canaan hill along the borderline<br>
<br>
They say old Sam was a veteran, he rode in the Cavalry<br>
Came home on a limping leg some time in sixty three<br>
He bought a saw and a scatter gun at Gadway's general store<br>
He said "I'm taking to the woods so they can't find me anymore<br>
<br>
CHORUS (No, they're never gonna...)<br>
<br>
Now every month on the twenty fifth, he'd come back to the store<br>
With a broken down old blue tick that would wait outside the door<br>
And he'd yell "Where's my check from the government and I want a block of cheese<br>
Then he put it in a handkerchief he kept tucked in his sleeves<br>
<br>
CHORUS (No, they're never gonna...)</blockquote>

<h3>Sarah Beth</h3>
<blockquote>On a foggy Sunday morning near the hills of Tennessee<br>
A young man was wandering, lost as he could be<br>
He left his home three years before to fight in '63<br>
Now that the war is over, his young heart still bleeds<br>
<br>
He longs for his Sarah Beth and his family<br>
But the Yankees came and took them all far from Tennessee<br>
So he roams the mountainsides calling her name<br>
"Sarah Beth, oh Sarah Beth, where are you today?"<br>
<br>
He searches for his mom and dad and things he can't explain<br>
Like where'd you go, how could you go, and why did you go away?<br>
<br>
After two weeks on the mountain, he returned to his town<br>
And burried beneath the rubble, this is what he found<br>
A letter from his Sarah Beth that never came his way<br>
And inside were the answers as to why she went away<br>
<br>
On the 7th day of April when the Union soldiers came<br>
Now the whole town is burning, there's no way I could stay<br>
<br>
So I'm heading north to Boston and there I'm gonna wait<br>
On the Rebel man I love so much to find me there some day<br>
So he rides across the mountainsides calling her name<br>
"Sarah Beth, oh Sarah Beth, I am on my way"<br>
<br>
When he made it north to Boston and he finally saw her face<br>
Said "I love you so, never let go, and I am here to stay"<br>
Said "I love you so, never let go, and I am here to stay"</blockquote>

Their cannons never thundered<br>
We chased 'em down to the river<br>
We whipped ol' Grant, the drunkard<br>

Be with the Southern soldier<br>
We'll drive the mercenary horde<br>

<br>
There's a tale that's told in Gettysburg<br>
Where lies an unknown grave<br>
They say if you're there at midnight<br>
A shadow arrives from the grave<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
It's seen each time at midnight<br>
Rising from the grave<br>
Lost in time, and left behind<br>
The shadow from the grave<br>
<br>
Some people say that they believe<br>
Its a soldier of the Civil War<br>
And they buried him where he fell<br>
And his soul will rest no more<br>

<h3>Sharpshooter's Blues</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
You'll get those sharpshooter's blues if I get my sights on you<br>
Don't think that you can get too far away<br>
It's bad news for you that I'm so good at what I do<br>
You won't know what hit you if you get those sharpshooter's blues<br>
<br>
Ten shots in ten at two hundred yards<br>
Makes me the best shot in these parts<br>
In just a flash you'll be glory bound<br>
And I'll have sargeant's stripes 'fore you're cold in the ground<br>
<br>
Cause I'll take that aim in this killing game<br>
Being a sharpshooter's been my claim to fame<br>
I'll hit the mark, Matthew Luke or John<br>
Give them all a ride to the great beyond<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
So stick your head up just one more time<br>
I'll draw a bead and let a bullet fly<br>
I can make sargeant if all that I got<br>
Was a big old general and a good clean shot<br>
<br>
Woah, a general's funeral is a sight to see<br>
They's pomp and circumstance, a sobbin' family<br>
When he's all laid down in his finery<br>
Too bad that he won't see these new stripes on me<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Well now who is that up in that tree?<br>
Through the smoke and the haze, it's kinda hard to see<br>
Wait a minute, he's got a bead on me<br>
Now I guess that I'm just a used-to-be<br>
<br>

<h3>Shenandoah Wind</h3>
<blockquote>In the time of troubles, as the war drew near<br>
I became a soldier, a Virginia volunteer<br>
Left my farm and family, and as I fell in step<br>
I heard my Peggy crying on the Shenandoah wind<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Take this pack from my shoulder<br>
Let me rest here, friend<br>
Tell my Peggy I love her<br>
And I'll be home on the Shenandoah wind<br>
<br>
Days were hot and dusty, nights bitter cold<br>
We followed General Jackson down the valley road<br>
We met the Yankee army, through the smoke and din<br>
I could hear the crying of the Shenandoah wind<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Now I walk the valley, wander in the hills<br>
Whisper on the water, and blow across the fields<br>
Through the Blue Ridge Mountains to the place so dear<br>
Where I kissed my Peggy, and I dry her tears<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>Sherman's March To The Sea</h3>
<blockquote>In the Columbia jail sat Joe Byers<br>
Of the Fifth Iowa Infantry<br>
To a friend near at hand, told the story<br>
Of Sherman's long march to the sea<br>
<br>
CHORUS (x2)<br>
Oh, they said that old Sherman was crazy<br>
No braver nor bolder could be<br>
And the stars in our banner are brighter<br>
For Sherman has marched to the sea<br>
For Sherman has marched to the sea<br>
<br>
When finally encamped in Savannah<br>
They hoisted the flag of the free<br>
And all men for all times in all places<br>
Will tell of the march to the sea<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
To the sea</blockquote>

<h3>Shiloh</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/24/mode/2up?q=shiloh"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
In the beautiful state of Tennessee<br>
Where the beautiful Tennessee river lazily winds its way<br>
Could we look back a hundred years or more to the 1860s?<br>
I wonder what our thoughts would be and what we would really say?<br>
<br>
Well, let's take ourselves back to April, the 6th and 7th, 1862, Shiloh, Tennessee<br>
There we find the Union soldiers resting in the wood<br>
Waiting for General Buell<br>
To join 'em just as quick as he could<br>
<br>
When General Albert S. Johnson came<br>
Upon Grant's men unaware<br>
The flaming line burst with shell and shot<br>
Grant's forces fought all they could there<br>
<br>
As General Hurlbut's 4th Division<br>
Held the grove of blooming peach trees<br>
And after seven hours of hell and shell<br>
The assaults and horrible slaughter, was awful for the human eye to see<br>
<br>
General Hurlbut's blue stand will always be remembered<br>
For its ferocity and pain endurance and for so many medals<br>
And the dead on the ground were thicker than peach blossoms<br>
Their flowers falling on the men as  petals<br>
<br>
In the awful slaughter at Shiloh, Grant lost fourteen thousand men<br>
The Confederates eleven thousand for the cause<br>
Can anyone ever dismiss the deaths<br>
Of twenty five thousand men without the proper pause?<br>
<br>
Albert Sidney Johnson made a promise: then and there, his<br>
Promise of attack was fulfilled<br>
He led his mighty troops on Shiloh<br>
And along with twenty five thousand others, Johnson was killed<br>
<br>
Thus ended another milestone in the Civil War<br>
Shiloh, Tennessee, you paid your price, and you'll be remembered forevermore</blockquote>

<h3>Shiloh's Hill</h3>
<blockquote>One of the early notable battles of the Civil War became known as Shiloh's Hill. Approximately 10,000 Union and Confederate soldiers lost their lives when Union soldiers assaulted a well-entrenched Confederate Army that held the high position on the field. This Civil War era song vividly describes the battle and its aftermath with a battlefield strewn with dead and wounded men from each side. The Union Army finally carried the field after a bloody struggle that included hand-to-hand combat. Sung in traditional style, the feelings of that hour, that battle, tend to pull the listener into the actual battle.<br>
<br>
Come all ye valiant soldiers -- a story I will tell<br>
About the bloody battle that was fought on Shiloh's Hill<br>
It was an awful struggle will make your blood to chill<br>
All from the bloody battle that was fought on Shiloh's Hill<br>
<br>
Twas on the sixth of April about the break of day<br>
The drums and fifes were playing for us to march away<br>
The feeling of that hour -- I do remember still<br>
When first my feet went tromping up on Shiloh's Hill<br>
<br>
About the hour of sunrise the battle did began<br>
Before the fight had ended we fought them hand-to-hand<br>
The horrors of that field did my heart with anguish fill<br>
For the dead and the dying that lay on Shiloh's Hill<br>
<br>
There were men from every nation laid on those bloody plains<br>
Fathers, sons, and brothers were numbered with the slain<br>
That has caused so many homes with deep mourning to be filled<br>
All from the bloody battle that was fought on Shiloh Hill<br>
<br>
The wounded men were crying for help from everywhere<br>
While others who were dying were offering God their prayer<br>
"Protect my wife and children if it is Thy holy will"<br>
Such were the prayers I heard that night up on Shiloh's Hill<br>
<br>
Twas early next morning we were called to fight again<br>
Unmindful of the dying unuseful to the slain<br>
The struggle was renewed again ten thousand was the kill<br>
And their blood flowed like water down off Shiloh's Hill (or This was the second conflict of the famous Shiloh Hill)<br>
<br>
The battle it raged on, though dead and dying men
Lay thick all o'er the ground, on the hill and on the glen<br>
And from their deadly wounds, the blood ran like a rill<br>
Such were the mournful sights that I saw on Shiloh Hill<br>
<br>
Before the day had ended, the battle ceased to roar<br>
And thousands of dead soldiers had fell to rise no more<br>
I pray to God the Savior consistent with thy will (or They left their vacant ranks for some other ones to fill)<br>
To save the souls of all those boys who died on Shiloh's Hill (or And now their mouldering bodies all lie on Shiloh Hill)<br>
<br>
And now my song is ended about those bloody plains<br>
I hope the sight by mortal man may ne'er be seen again!<br>
But I pray to God, the Saviour, "If consistent with Thy will<br>
To save the souls of all who fell on bloody Shiloh Hill."<br>
<br>
Lord , save the souls of all who fell on bloody Shiloh's Hill.</blockquote>

<h3>Soldier's Last Letter Home</h3>
<blockquote>When in Camp Letterman Hospital, following wound and capture in Pickett's Charge, great uncle John Creasy, whose wounds were not as severe as others, related to family after the war that he wrote several letters for soldiers who were gravely ill from wounds or were dying while there. "A Soldier's Last Letter Home" represents such a letter to a father of a dying soldier. In it the soldier pleads with a comrade that the letter be mailed today, showing the urgency to get his last words home to help comfort his loved ones.<br>
<br>
Well dear father I write this letter<br>
Cause I wont be coming home<br>
I was wounded here at Shiloh<br>
And now must die alone<br>
<br>
The good Doctor says it's fatal<br>
And that I prepare to go<br>
So I'm writing you this letter<br>
A few lines to let you know<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
Now Soldier take this letter<br>
And mail it out today<br>
I see the angels coming<br>
For to carry me away<br>
<br>
My last thoughts are of family<br>
And how you cared for me<br>
But I had to join this army<br>
To help keep the southland free<br>
<br>
Tell sweet Mary that I will miss her<br>
And give her this kiss goodbye<br>
Tell her that I will meet her<br>
Some day up there in the sky<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Tell dear mother that I love her<br>
And grieve not to long for me<br>
From all this pain and suffering<br>
I know I'll soon be free<br>
<br>
Now dear father please forgive me<br>
For leaving you all alone<br>
And sweet Mama I'm so sorry<br>
That I won't be coming home<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Yes I hear the beat of angel wings to carry me away</blockquote>

<h3>Soldier's Song (aka Southern Soldier)</h3>
<blockquote>Now place my knapsack on my back<br>
My rifle on my shoulder<br>
I'll march away to the firing line<br>
And kill that enemy soldier<br>
And kill that enemy soldier<br>
I'll march away to the firing line<br>
And kill that enemy soldier<br>
<br>
I'll bid farewell to my wife and child<br>
Farewell to my aged mother<br>
And go and join in the bloody strife<br>
Til this cruel war is over<br>
Til this cruel war is over<br>
I'll go and join in the bloody strife<br>
Til this cruel war is over<br>
<br>
If I am shot on a battlefied<br>
And I should not recover<br>
Oh, who will protect my wife and child<br>
And care for my aged mother<br>
And care for my aged mother<br>
Oh, who will protect my wife and child<br>
And care for my aged mother<br>
<br>
If I must die for my home and land<br>
My spirit will not falter<br>
Oh, here's my heart and here's my hand<br>
Upon my country's altar<br>
Upon my country's altar<br>
Oh, here's my heart and here's my hand<br>
Upon my country's altar</blockquote>

<h3>The Soldier's Wooing</h3>
<blockquote>'The Yankee Soldier.' From an anonymous typescript which Dr. White, both from the manner of the accompanying note and from the mention of Mrs. Buchanan of Horse Creek, assigns confidently to Mrs. [Maude Minish] Sutton. The note says in part : "It seems strange that there are so few Civil War ballads in the mountains.... 'The Yankee Soldier' is neither pretty nor gruesome.... I am indebted for this copy to Mrs. Buchanan of Horse Creek." Of course it is not really a Civil War ballad; merely an adaptation. Dr. White notes on the typescript that he found this song in Alabama in 1916.
<br>
A story about a Yankee a-comin' from the war.<br>
He courted Lilly Marrit, a secret from her pa.<br>
Her pa was so wealthy it scarcely can be told.<br>
She loved that Yankee soldier because he was so bold.<br>
<br>
'Lilly Margaret, daughter, my word you'd better mind.
I'll shut [you] in a cave, your body I'll confine.'<br>
'O father, cruel father, my body you can confine,<br>
But you can't put the Yankee soldier from out my mind.'<br>
<br>
Then up spoke the Yankee soldier: 'Oh, never mind the tattle.<br>
If I'm to be a married man I shore can fight a battle.'<br>
So his bride she hel' the horses and the Yankee fought the battle,<br>
So his bride she hel' the horses and the Yankee fought the battle.<br>
<br>
The first man that come lie shot through the brain,<br>
An' the next man that come he served him the same.<br>
'Fly,' said the others, 'your sons will all be slain;<br>
To fight the Yankee soldier you see it is in vain.'<br>5 
<br>
'O Yankee, O Yankee, don't strike your licks so bold,<br>
Fur I'll give to you my daughter and forty pounds o' gold.'<br>
'No,' says the daughter, 'the sum it is too small.<br>
Fight on, my Yankee soldier, you soon will git it all.'</blockquote>

<h3>Someone Play Dixie For Me</h3>
<blockquote>In the year '64, we were fighting a war<br>
For a reason that we hardly knew<br>
Many tears had been shed, many loved ones left dead<br>
In the fight 'tween the gray and the blue<br>
<br>
I recall that lad, to his mother and dad<br>
Said goodbye at the old garden gate<br>
And I heard mother say "Son, we'll watch and we'll pray<br>
If it takes you forever, we'll wait"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
If they carry me back on that long, Southern track<br>
I hope you will answer my plea<br>
When they lower me down in that sweet Georgia ground<br>
Can someone play Dixie for me?<br>
<br>
Many years slowly passed til a letter at last<br>
From his captain had finally come home<br>
"For the one that you yearn, he will never return<br>
Lord, he's died in a camp way up north"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
With a rose on his chest, we fulfilled his last request<br>
What God gave, He'd now taken away<br>
With his battles now won, Lord, his song it was sung<br>
While the tune to sweet Dixie they played<br>
<br>
CHORUS (... Have someone play Dixie for me)<br>
<br>
When they lower me down in that sweet Georgia ground<br>
Have someone play Dixie for me</blockquote>

<h3>Song of the South</h3>
<blockquote>Cotton on roadside, cotton in the ditch<br>
We all picked the cotton but we never got rich<br>
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat<br>
Said "They oughta kill a rich man to vote like that"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Song, Song of the south<br>
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth<br>
Gone, gone with the wind<br>
There ain't no body looking back again<br>
<br>
Well I was eighteen 'fore I ate my fill<br>
We lived on the garden and the cow's goodwill<br>
Winter was wet and summer was dry<br>
And momma, she was old at thirty-five<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Well somebody told us that Wall Street fell<br>
So damn poor we couldn't tell<br>
The cotton was short, and the weeds was tall<br>
Mr. Roosevelt's a' gonna save us all<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Well momma got sick, and daddy got down<br>
The county got the farm, and we moved to town<br>
Daddy took a job with the TVA<br>
We bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>The Southern Girl's Reply</h3>
<blockquote>I cannot listen to your words, this land’s so far and wide<br>
Go find some happy northern girl to be your loving bride<br>
My brothers they were soldiers. The youngest of the three<br>
was slain while fighting by the side of General Fitzhugh Lee<br>
<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah! For the sunny South I say<br>
Three cheers for the southern girl and the boys that wore the gray<br>
<br>
My lover was a soldier, too, he fought at God’s command<br>
A sabre pierced his gallant heart. You might have been the man<br>
He reeled and fell but was not dead, a horseman spurred his steed<br>
and trampled on his dying brain. You might have done the deed<br>
<br>
They left his body on the field whom the fight the day had won<br>
A horseman spurred him with his heel, you might have been the one<br>
But there’s no hatred in my heart, nor cold nor righteous pride<br>
for many’s the gallant soldier’s fell upon the other side<br>
<br>
But still I cannot take the hand that smote my country sore<br>
nor love the foe that trampled on the colors that she wore<br>
Between my heart and yours there rose a deep and crimson tide<br>
My lover’s and my brother’s blood forbids me be your bride.</blockquote>

<h3>Southern Son</h3>
<blockquote>The year was 1861, in the farmlands of the South<br>
The family was small and poor, they lived from hand to mouth<br>
The father told his only boy "Please, son, don't leave"<br>
The boy said "Dad, I'm sorry, my country's calling me"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And they fought for what they thought was right<br>
And they thought that victory was in sight<br>
To the bitter end, they spilled their tears and their blood<br>
Fighting for the South in the cruel Virginia mud<br>
<br>
Well, the boy joined the army with many courageous men<br>
And they fought very bravely, their freedom to win<br>
What they thought would last a little while turned to long years<br>
They outgrew their sadness and forgot all their fears<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
The battle raged for three long days, men were wounded and dying<br>
The young son went down, but there was no one by his side<br>
He looked up to Heaven and this was his plea:<br>
"Lord, I don't want to die, I'm only seventeen"<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Dying for the South in the cruel Virginia mud</blockquote>

<h3>Sticks that Made Thunder</h3>
<blockquote>My roots are deeper than the bones the others<br>
My colors they change with the sun<br>
My branches we're higher than anything on the hillside<br>
On the day that I watched them all come<br>
<br>
Some were the color of the sky in the winter<br>
Some were as blue as the night<br>
They came like a storm with the light of the morn<br>
And they fell thru the whole day and night<br>
<br>
Colors flew high and they danced in the sky<br>
As I watched them come over the hill<br>
Then to my wonder sticks that made thunder<br>
Such a great number lay still<br>
When the light came again there was death on the wind<br>
As the buzzards made way for the worms<br>
And the little white trees that don't bend in the breeze<br>
For the ones that will never return<br>
<br>
The colors flew high and they danced in the sky<br>
As I watched them come over the hill<br>
Then to my wonder sticks that made thunder<br>
Such a great number lay still<br>
<br>
Those that have fallen they come when I call them<br>
And answer the best that they can<br>
But all they can see is what they used to be<br>
And that's all that they understand<br>
<br>
The colors flew high and they danced in the sky<br>
As I watched them come over the hill<br>
Then to my wonder sticks that made thunder<br>
Such a great number lay still<br>
<br>
Colors flew high and they danced in the sky<br>
As I watched them come over the hill<br>
Then to my wonder sticks that made thunder</blockquote>

<h3>Stonewall's Brigade</h3>
<blockquote>Beats of Civil War we hear, over and over again<br>
How the foot cavalry marched far, thirty miles of daily pain<br>
<br>
How the Second Virginia Infantry made up of Stonewall's men<br>
And how Lee's Northern Army did valor for them win<br>
<br>
How Gettysburg and Bull Run fought endlessly and on<br>
They pushed themselves on a ceaseless drive, forced Federals to be gone<br>
<br><!--
Shadows of Manassas stood like a wall of stone<br>
Took shot and onslought, lost an arm to one of his own<br>
<br> -->
Chancellorsville bears witness, how Lee's right-arm man stood<br>
They looked for a man to replace him, but Lee nor no man could<br>
<br><!--
Ordinary men and causes repaid highest bravery made<br>
Southland's vales and hills felt the fury of Stonewall's brigade<br>
<br>-->
And still the battle flag waves proud, turmoils of war to tell<br>
Stonewall's brigade we honor yet, memory taps for those who fell<br>
<br>
Beats of Civil War we hear, over and over again<br>

<h3>The Stranger</h3>
<blockquote>This song is about the Colley family of Gray, Maine, who were faced with the problem of what to do with the body of a Confederate Soldier mis-idenfified as their son.  See more <a href="https://www.graymaine.org/history/pages/the-unknown-confederate-soldier">here</a> and <a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/dave-rowe-writes-song-about-grays-civil-war-stranger/97-224710105">here</a>.<br> 
<br>
From that Cedar Mountain battle of 1862<br>
Came a fallen soldier's casket as the 10th Maine paid its dues<br>
Grieving parents braced to see their Union son lay dead<br>
But in his place they found a boy in southern gray instead<br>
<br>
As the tears rolled down their faces, they searched vainly for his name<br>
But they never learned who journeyed to their village up in Maine<br>
Without the funds to send him back, he was burried like buried like their own<br>
And there above his resting place, carved "Stranger" on a stone<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And the stranger in gray is lying there today<br>
A misdirected casualty of war<br>
Surrounded by the ones who'd fired the Union guns<br>
The stranger in gray will see Dixie nevermore<br>
<br>
Fate must have a sense of humor as it winds along its way<br>
For it sent the gray-clad stranger to a little town named Gray<br>
But even when the real son was found and buried there<br>
The town made sure the stranger was included in their prayers<br>
<br>
And when the ladies placed the flowers and the flags are left to wave<br>
Beside the strangers' flowers, a Rebel flag flies on his grave<br>
Now he lies there with the others who in life he sought to kill<br>
All the rifle fire has ended while the cannonballs are still<br>
<br>
And the flowers of blue grow softly on the strangers' marble stone<br>
To show to all that blue and gray don't have to be alone<br>
<br>
CHORUS (... The stranger in gray is no stranger anymore)<br>
<br>
Yes the stranger in gray will see Dixie nevermore</blockquote>

<h3>Sweatshop Fire</h3>
<blockquote>I'm gonna burn like a sweatshop fire<br>

There ain't no Tupelo midnight got nothing on me<br>

There’s always daybreak at the edge of night<br>

I'm blowing in, the last blizzard of the year<br>
I'm giving up on the church, like I was never even here<br>
This storm's gonna hi in the springtime, burn out the roots like a frost<br>
I'm gonna leave the county at the mercy of the salt trucks<br>
This heart is as black as any union boss<br>
I'm gonna sink down like a frost I'm gonna burn out the roots<br>
<br>
Just as sure as Jack Ruby's gonna set things right<br>
There's always daybreak at the edge of night<br>
And this time I'm gonna burn like a sweatshop fire<br>

can't help but feel strange<br>
headin north in a pouring rain<br>
Another lonesome night<br>
shadows move by fire light<br>
Fiddle plays a melody<br>
whippoorwill cries mournfully<br>
in my pocket I keep a cross<br>
right now I never felt so lost<br>
<br>
Oh angel, carry me<br>
Make sure I find my way back home<br>
to Tennessee<br>
to Tennessee<br>
<br>
Been a year since I've been gone<br>
write another letter home<br>
Tell about the boys that fell<br>
I still hear their rebel yell<br>
and it haunts me in my sleep<br>
I find escape in revere<br>
<br>
Shell shattered country side<br>
mini balls whistle by<br>
My company's stripped bare<br>
smell of sulfur fills the air<br>
Strange burning in my side<br>
I find I'm staring at the sky</blockquote>

<h3>The Texas Ranger</h3>
<blockquote>'The Texas Ranger.' Communicated by Mrs. [Maude Minish] Sutton, with the notation, "This, like many others I have, must be attributed to Mrs. J. J. Miller. She could not read or write when I first heard her sing it. She had doubtless never seen a cowboy nor did she have the least idea of what the work and life of a 'Texas Ranger' was. Yet she liked these songs very much and took a lot of pleasure in their melancholy. She said she thought her father learned the latter in the war. He taught it to her. Like many people whose range of experience is limited, she has a marvelous memory." Observe that the action here is transferred from Texas to the Civil War in Virginia.<br>
<br>
Come all ye Texas Rangers<br>
And listen unto me,<br>
I will tell you of some trouble<br>
That happened unto me.<br>
<br>
My name is nothing extry,<br>
My name I will not tell.<br>
It is to you, all true rangers,<br>
I know I wish ye well.
<br>
At the age of sixteen<br>
I joined a jolly band<br>
And marched from Western Texas<br>
To old Virginia's land.<br>
<br>
Our captain did inform us,<br>
Because he thought it right,<br>
Before we reached Manassas<br>
We sure would have to fight.<br>
<br>
We seen the Yankees comin',<br>
Our captain give command:<br>
'To arms, to arms!' he shouted.<br>
'And by your horses stand.'<br>
<br>
We saw the Yankess comin',<br>
Their bullets round us hailed.<br>
My heart sunk within me,<br>
My courage purt' near failed.<br>
<br>
We charged agin them Yankees,<br>
We give the Rebel yell,<br>
And many of them Yankees,<br>
They soon woke up in hell.</blockquote>

<h3>Texas Outlaw</h3>
<blockquote>Thunder of hooves, the dust it chokes the day<br>
Flames took my home, the smoke was my child's grave<br>
<br>
Run away, run away, shoulda killed me where I lay<br>
Run away, run away, revenge is the price you'll pay<br>
<br>
Dixie has fallen, the Union Might has won<br>
Our boys swore your oath, but you fed 'em to your guns<br>
<br>
On the run, on the run, I'll hunt you every one<br>
On the run, on the run, my war is not yet done<br>
<br>
I headed west, with the Jayhawkers on my trail<br>
I'm heading down into Texas, I’m gonna take ‘em straight to hell<br>
<br>
Run away, run away, shoulda killed me that first day<br>
I run away, run away, I'll lead you to your grave<br>
<br>
Last of my kin with a price upon my head<br>
Five thousand reasons for them to want me dead<br>
<br>
On the run, on the run, I'll hunt you every one<br>
On the run, on the run, my war is not yet done<br>
<br>
My name called out from the captain of the Cavalry<br>
My gun ran dry, but with his sword I bled him slowly<br>
<br>
On the run, on the run, I'll hunt you every one<br>
On the run, on the run, my war is not yet done</blockquote>

<h3>Thirteen Steps</h3>
<blockquote>This morning I awoke to the sound of the hammer<br>
Building the scaffold high<br>
If the pardon don't come from the president<br>
Today I will die<br>
<br>
Anna, don't you weep, my dear daughter<br>
I can stand anything but that<br>
Lay my body near the simple stone that says<br>
Missus Surratt<br>
<br>
One man pulled the trigger<br>
Two men told a lie<br>
Three men will hang with me<br>
And thirteen steps we will climb<br>
<br>
Mary Jenkins I was born on the Maryland shore<br>
Married at sixteen<br>
To a gentleman, but then we lost the land<br>
Then we had to leave<br>
<br>
To Virginia we did go, Prince George's County<br>
Troubles there were few<br>
John did well in Surrattsville<br>
Til he died in '62<br>
<br>
Four cards around me<br>
Five words of hope<br>
Six feet they've dug for me<br>
And thirteen steps to the rope<br>
<br>
Here, my boarding house up on Eighth Street<br>
In the heart of Washington<br>
Many men passed but I never asked<br>
Just friends of my son<br>
<br>
On that April morn, on Good Friday<br>
I saw John Wilkes Booth<br>
He said "Tell Lloyd to watch the store"<br>
Cause they'd be riding through<br>
<br>
On the seventh day of seven<br>
Eighteen sixty five<br>
Nine men said guilty<br>
And thirteen steps til I die<br>
<br>
They paid for my son, John M. told me<br>
Where he had run<br>
When I saw those two words I understood<br>
What those boys had done<br>
<br>
They say the War is through, the killing's over<br>
I hear it in the song<br>
As I ask with my last breath<br>
Please, don't let me fall<br>
<br>
Ten weeks in prison<br>
Eleven is my name<br>
Twelve gates to the city<br>
And thirteen steps to the grave</blockquote>

<h3>This Favored Land</h3>
<blockquote>Those who could, came, traveled by train<br>
To gather together in kind<br>
To honor the slain, frail of frame<br>
Now our final remind<br>
<br>
Borne on stretchers with wheelchairs and canes<br>
White bearded uniformed, a faded parade<br>
<br>
The drums of battle are silent now<br>
Three score and fifteen have passed<br>
On Cemetery Ridge the rifles are still<br>
Please the army of the land<br>
<br>
On either side of the wall they stand<br>
As brothers this time in this favored land<br>
<br>
It's a long road<br>
They've not much longer to go<br>
Remember<br>
John Boston<br>
Sires Noble<br>
Marah Kinney<br>
Collin O'Bond<br>
<br>
With wives and sons and daughters they've come<br>
To forgive the ghost of the past</blockquote>

<h3>Three Days In July</h3>
<blockquote>(see also: <a href="https://bluegrasstoday.com/the-story-behind-the-song-three-days-in-july/">The Story Behind the Song – Three Days in July</a> by Richard Thompson in <i>Bluegrass Today</i>)<br>
<br>
I was born in Pennsylvania in 1851<br>
Grew up on my father’s farm, the youngest of three sons<br>
The Civil War was raging the year that I turned twelve<br>
My father joined the ranks of blue and left us by ourselves<br>
<br>
Boys I’ll tell you true, I learned things I never knew
<br>
In summer heat we prayed for rain, the first day of July<br>
Far off thunder rumbling, no storm clouds in the sky<br>
My brothers grabbed their rifles—”stay,” my mother urged<br>
Mama, that’s the sound of cannon up by Gettysburg<br>
<br>
Boys I’ll tell you true, I learned things I never knew<br>
<br>
Two fearful days and sleepless nights, we waited with no word<br>
‘Til the guns fell silent on the morning of the third<br>
My mother watched the road all day, and kept me there close by<br>
‘Til dusk was hard upon us and the water jug was dry<br>
<br>
With bucket and a lantern I crossed the field alone<br>
Heard the sound of snapping twigs, and then a quiet moan<br>
Captured in my lantern light, his face an ashen grey<br>
Huddled in a bloody coat a rebel soldier lay<br>
<br>
Boys I’ll tell you true, I learned things I never knew<br>
<br>
“I see you have a kind face, please don’t raise the cry<br>
If I am taken prisoner, I know I’ll surely die<br>
I’m wounded and I mean no harm, just need to rest a spell<br>
I have fled the battlefield, I’ve seen the face of hell<br>
<br>
We came by tens of thousands, the battle for to lose<br>
And we only marched on Gettysburg, because we needed shoes”<br>
I looked down at his swollen feet, and tried to understand<br>
And wondered if my brothers had died at this man’s hand<br>
<br>
Boys I’ll tell you true, I learned things I never knew<br>
<br>
I walked back in the cabin, I set the bucket down<br>
I spoke no word to mother of why I’d been so long<br>
All night we sat beside the fire, praying for good news<br>
Then mother she looked down and asked: “Son, where are your shoes?”<br>
<br>
Boys I’ll tell you true, I learned things I never knew<br>
Boys I’ll tell you true, I learned things I never knew</blockquote>

<h3>Those Cruel Slavery Days</h3>
<blockquote>On the day that ol' Marster died<br>
All the slaves we stood and cried<br>
Those agonizing cruel slavery days<br>
For they knew we would be sold<br>
for the silver and the gold<br>
Those agonizing cruel slavery days<br>
<br>
Oh, They sold my brother Sam<br>
To a man from Alabam'<br>
My sister went to Georgia far away<br>
Then they broke my heart for life<br>
when they sold my darlin' wife<br>
Those agonizing cruel slavery days<br>
<br>
In that ol' Virginia State<br>
Where they made us separate<br>
Those agonizing cruel slavery days<br>
Well they broke the old man's heart<br>
when they said we had to part<br>
Those agonizing cruel slavery days<br>
<br>
When I'm all alone at night<br>
and the fire is burning bright<br>
And I think of happy days of long ago<br>
When us darkies all would sing<br>
and the banjers they would ring<br>
Those days could never come to me no more<br>
<br>
When our work on earth is done<br>
and we gather one by one<br>
In that land where all tears are washed away<br>
There we'll need to part no more<br>
on that beautiful golden shore<br>
Where there will never be no cruel slavery days</blockquote>

<h3>Traveller</h3>
<blockquote>The song, "Traveller" is a tribute to the greatness and valor of General Robert E. Lee's favorite horse that served him throughout the Civil War as his main mount. Traveller was raised in Greenbrier County, Virginia, now West Virginia. West Virginia seceded from Virginia, June 20, 1863 and became the only political change resulting from the Civil War. General Lee Purchased Traveller, then named Greenbrier, from Captain Joseph M. Broun, quartermaster of the 3rd Virginia Infantry. General Lee is represented astride Traveller on monuments at the Gettysburg National Battlefield and in Richmond, Virginia and in many paintings and photographs. Following General Lee's surrender, he rode Traveller home. When General Lee died in 1870, Traveller was led behind the hearse in the funeral procession.<br>
<br>
This is the only song recorded about Traveller.<br>
<br>
For four long years he labored to keep the Southland free.<br>
<br>
In the War Between the States many soldiers brave and true<br>
Gave their all to fight the cause for the grey or blue<br>
But one we seldom hear about who never showed his fear<br>
Was a horse named Traveler that General Lee held dear<br>
<br>
From the hills of West Virginia came this valiant horse so stout<br>
To serve the Rebel Army as the General's mount<br>
He never once complained about the burden that he bore<br>
He was his trusted comrade throughout the civil war<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
A proud and gentle steed, he gladly did his part<br>
For in his chest of silver grey, there beat a southern heart<br>
Amid the smoke of battle, he stood by the General's side<br>
Carried him ten thousand miles and did it all with pride<br>
<br>
With great dignity and valor, he carried General Lee<br>
And earned a place of honor in our Nation's History<br>
In eighteen sixty-five when the North had won<br>
And their job was over, he carried him back home<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
He was the trusted comrade of Robert E. Lee.</blockquote>

<h3>Two Little Boys</h3>
<blockquote>Two Little Boys had two little toys<br>
Each had a wooden horse<br>
Gaily they played each summer day<br>
Warriors both of course<br>
One little chap had a mishap<br>
And broke off his horse's head<br>
Wept for his toy then cried with joy<br>
When he heard his brother say:<br>
<br>
"Do you think I could leave you cryin'<br>
When there's room on my horse for you<br>
Climb up here, Jack you stop your cryin'<br>
We'll mend up your horse with glue<br>
When we grow up we'll both be soldiers<br>
Our horses will not be toys<br>
And maybe you will remember<br>
When we were two little boys."<br>
<br>
Long years have passed, war came at last<br>
Bravely they marched away<br>
Cannons roared loud and in that wild crowd<br>
Where wounded and dyin' Joe lay<br>
Then came a cry a rider dashed by<br>
Out from the ranks of blue<br>
Galloped away to where Joe lay<br>
Then he heard his brother say<br>
<br>
Do you think I could leave you dyin'<br>
When there's room on my horse for two<br>
Climb up here, Joe - we'll soon be flyin'<br>
To the ranks of the boys in Blue<br>
Can't you see, Jack I'm all a-tremble<br>
It may be the flash and the noise<br>
Or maybe because I remember<br>
When we were two little boys.</blockquote>

<h3>The Two Soldiers</h3>
<blockquote>'The Two Soldiers.' "Sent to C. Alphonso Smith by I. G. Greer, of Boone, N. C., Aug. 6, 1913." Professor Smith gave this and other songs to Professor Brown. This text shows a considerable number of differences from both of Belden's, is in general more colloquial, and more often misses the sense of what the original must have conveyed (e.g., "fate," for "faith"? in stanza 3).<br>
<br>
It was just before the last fierce charge,<br>
Two soldiers drew their reins,<br>
With a parting word and a touch of the hand--<br>
They might never meet again.<br>
<br>
One had blue eyes and curly hair,<br>
Nineteen but a month ago;<br>
There was red on his cheek, and down on his chin;<br>
He was only a lad, you know.
<br>
The other was a tall, dark man,<br>
Whose fate in this world was dim,<br>
But he only trusted the more on those<br>
Who were all the world to him.<br>
<br>
They had ridden together thru many a round,<br>
And marched for many a mile,<br>
But never before had they met their foe<br>
With a calm and a helpless smile.<br>
<br>
The first to speak was the tall, dark man,<br>
Saying, 'Charlie, my time has come;<br>
We'll up yonder hill together,<br>
But you'll come back alone.<br>
<br>
'Will you promise a little trouble to take<br>
For me when I am gone?<br>
I have a picture next to my heart,<br>
With blue eyes and curly hair.<br>
<br>
'As morning light she was to me,<br>
For she gladdened a lonely life,<br>
And little cared I for the thought of fate<br>
When she promised to be my wife.<br>
<br>
'Oh, Charlie, write to her tenderly,<br>
Send her back this fair, fond face,<br>
Tell her tenderly how I died<br>
And where is my resting place.<br>
<br>
'Tell her my soul shall wait for her<br>
In a bordering land between,<br>
In a space between heaven and earth,<br>
And it won't be long, it seems.'<br>
<br>
Tears dimmed the blue eyes of the boy;<br>
His voice was low with pain.<br>
'I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,<br>
If I ride back again.
<br>
'But if you ride back and I am dead,<br>
You must do as much for me.<br>
My mother at home must hear the news;<br>
Write to her tenderly.<br>
<br>
'One after another of those she loved,<br>
She buried both father and son,<br>
And I am the last of my country's call;<br>
She prayed and sent me on.<br>
<br>
'She's praying at home like a waiting saint,<br>
Her fair face wet with tears;<br>
Her heart will be broken when she hears I'm dead.<br>
But I'll see her soon, I know.'<br>
<br>
Just then the order came to march.<br>
For an instant hand touched hand.<br>
They answered, 'Aye'; then on they rode,<br>
That brave, devoted band.<br>
<br>
Right over the crest of the hill they dashed,<br>
Where rebels with shot and shell<br>
Poured earth of dust in their towering ranks,<br>
And they charged them as they fell.<br>
<br>
And of those that were left among the dead<br>
Was the boy with the curly hair,<br>
And the tall, dark man that rode by his side<br>
Lay dead beside him there.<br>
<br>
No one to tell the blue-eyed girl<br>
The words her lover said;<br>
No one to tell the weeping mother<br>
Her only son was dead.<br>
<br>
They never will know the last fond thoughts<br>
That were sought to soften a pain,<br>
Until they cross the river of death<br>
And stand by their sides again.</blockquote>

<h3>The Undelivered Message</h3>
<blockquote>Gettysburg was his home, and on Culp's Hill he played<br>
Til as a young man he said goodbye to his family<br>
Then the War Between the States found him in Virginia<br>
Fighting for the South and Robert E. Lee<br>
<br>
Well, he came upon and old friend, a wounded boy in blue<br>
Who asked him if he'd take a message home<br>
Home to his sweetheart, Jack Skelly, he was dying<br>
"Please, Wes, can you take this message home"<br>
<br>
Back home, his Jenny Wade is waiting<br>
Waiting for Jack Skelly's face to see<br>
For she had no way of knowing<br>
That her hopes and dreams would never be<br>
<br>
As the Rebels marched to Culp's Hill, Wes carried Jack's message on<br>
But a Yankee bullet found its mark that day<br>
And with his dying breath he whispered, "Jack, I tried to keep my word<br>
So close, my friend, but oh so far away"<br>
<br>
Jenny heard the battle raging all around her on Culp's Hill<br>
She prayed for peace and wished that it was so<br>
A stray shot through the window, her precious life was taken<br>
Whether or South, no one will ever know<br>
<br>
From the Old Dominion to the Keystone<br>
He knew he would be back home somde day<br>
To the hill he'd played on in childhood<br>
Wesley Culp was coming home to stay</blockquote>

<h3>Union Drummer Boy</h3>
<blockquote>Fallen snow lay in patches like a faded pony side<br>
And a tiny stream ran crimson from the blood of those who died<br>
There were no bands a-playing, nor crowds to shout with joy<br>
One lad left of the regiment, the Union drummer boy<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Drummer boy, I see the tears for the many friends you've lost<br>
<br>Just as you, I wonder too, at the price that freedom cost<br>
<br>
Well, the Autumn day so far away keeps coming to your mind<br>
When the company of men in blue marched to your drumming time<br>
The general reviewed his men, then spurred his horse to trot<br>
The Autumn leaves, like a patch-work quilt, lay on the mountaintop<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Well, it was so many years ago, it seemed like yesterday<br>
To the old man in his rocking chair, as his voice begins to fade<br>
A tiny drum rests in his lap, not real, it's just a toy<br>
And a sparkling tear runs down his cheek, the Union drummer boy</blockquote>

<h3>The Union Mare And The Confederate Grey	</h3>
<blockquote>Two horses were running, they pranced as they ran<br>
They'd both been commanded by a cavalry man<br>
Two horses stood grazing where their dead riders lay<br>
A Union mare and Confederate grey<br>
<br>
They nuzzled each other as they pranced and had fun<br>
They bathed in the warm rays of that old Southern sun<br>
No more senseless orders for them to obey<br>
So they frolicked like lovers, this mare and this grey<br>
<br>
Now these are such sad times that we're all living in<br>
For killing your brother is the mightiest sin<br>
But, oh, how happy we'd be if we just lived for today<br>
Like the Union mare and Confederate grey</blockquote>

<h3>V.M.I.'s Gallant Hour</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/32/mode/2up?q=gallant"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
They loved the role of rugged boys in a military school<br>
Back then they didn't even know New Market's dreaded rule<br>
When disaster bluntly told to dress for battlefield parade then<br>
Too soon the boys' rapture left, and suddenly they were men<br>
<br>
Two hundredy forty seven marched in Breckenridge's command<br>
And when they got to New Market, they were fighting hand to hand<br>
Then bullets answered to their charge; ten died with muffled cries<br>
Now forty seven boys were wounded men and their dying quelled their sighs<br>
<br>
Their white and gold flag proudly waved as they charged up the hill<br>
The pice they paid, we'll ne'er forget, their memories living still still<br>
Young heroes brave from V.M.I., their faces wet with rain<br>
Charged up the hill and turned the tide as they fought pain with pain<br><!--
<br>
General Lee must somehow know these boys that did him proud<br>
Earned their place on the scroll above life's highest cloud<br>
So that all of these have not, will not have died in vain<br>
Tradition draws on them, be on the ready to die again--></blockquote>

<h3>Vicksburg</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
Lay me down, turn it on over<br>
In that ground of hard, red clay<br>
Don't no one shed a tear for me<br>
'Cause I'll see you all on the Judgment Day<br>
<br>
Well, I once rode with a boy named Billy<br>
Through the hills of Arkansas<br>
He promised me a big pile of money<br>
But I knew we'd have to break the law<br>
<br>
We rode down in the Mississipi<br>
South of Memphis, through the Natchez Trace<br>
We stopped somewhere outside of Vicksburg<br>
Where we were to camp and wait<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
We woke up to the sound of thunder<br>
Rolling in, thirty horses strong<br>
They caught wind of us in Jackson<br>
That little girl had done us wrong<br>
<br>
A river boat floating through Vicksburg<br>
Big Miss Kimbell was in the stair<br>
We could've been out of there by Sunday<br>
But Billy had to spread a little cane<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Yeah, see you all on the Judgement Day</blockquote>

<h3>Virginia's Heritage</h3>
<blockquote>Adapted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/leescommand0000unse/page/118/mode/2up?q=heritage"><i>Lee's Command</i> by Albert J. Russo</a><br>
<br>
When General Lee refused to ruin a state who him befriended<br>
He chose his beloved Virginia, many Federal ties were ended<br>
<br>
Manassas, Richmond, and Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, and Petersburg's crater<br>
Appomattox with its sad sequel made hallowed history later<br>
<br>
The Army of Northern Virginia, ever present as the dogwood trees<br>
They did Virginia's valor proud, Stuart and Stonewall of Lee's<br>
<br>
Sixty percent of Civil War battles were fought on Virginia soil<br>
Abundant red blood earth holds heroes sweat and blood and toil<br>
<br>
Virginia didn't fail our country as "mother of Presidents" state<br>
Confederate capital in Richmond made Richmond's honor great<br>
<br>
Brandy Station saw the charge, Stuart's horses galloped hard<br>
Ten thousand Federal cavalrymen were beaten by Virginia's guard<br>
<br>
Let's stand and count Virginia's blessings, with heavy heart and hand<br>
The Southland, with its "stars and bars," lives on in Lee's command<br>
<br>
When the Federals nearer Richmond came, a whisper in a churchly pew<br>
Jefferson Davis hastily moved his capital to Danville as the war pursued<br>
<br>
Sixty percent of Civil War battles were fought on Virginia soil<br>
Abundant red blood earth holds heroes sweat and blood and toil</blockquote>

<h3>When The Bands Played</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
When the bands played "Home Sweet Home" they all just sang along<br>
Each and ever word to that bittersweet old song<br>
The men in Blue, the men in Gray, found comfort in those tones<br>
When the bands played "Home Sweet Home" they all just sang along<br>
<br>
Christmas time in '62 camped two armies Gray and Blue<br>
So close that they could hear the other band so clear<br>
And on both sides of the line for home they all did pine<br>
Brave spirits, their bands played favorite songs of the day<br>
<br>
As the lights began to fade, "Dixie's Land" was played<br>
And the "Hail Columbia" we heard, sure enough<br>
Then one struck up a tune and the others joined in too<br>
As the soldiers sang along, the words to Home Sweet Home<br>
<br>
CHORUS (x2; first time normal, second time: <b>Though cold and tired and hungry</b>, they found comfort in those tones)</blockquote>

<h3>Whistlin' Dixie</h3>
<blockquote>CHORUS<br>
Possum up a gum tree, sugar in the corn<br>
Tell you what's gonna be sure as you're born<br>
I ain't just a-whistling Dixie<br>
We're gonna have a jubilation down south<br>
<br>
Way down yonder in the cotton field<br>
I used to work all the day long<br>
When I was just a little babe my momma rocked me in the cradle<br>
And she'd always sing this song<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Some folks born just to sit around<br>
Yeah, life's kinda funny that way<br>
Now I was born to pick the cotton but I sure ain't forgotten<br>
Every dog's gonna have his day<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Well, right away soon, it won't be very long<br>
I'm gonna lay down all of my cares<br>
And the bells'll be a-ringin' and the angels a-singin'<br>
As we climb up the golden stairs<br>
<br>
CHORUS (We're gonna have a jubilation, a mighty celebration, have a jubilation down -- way down south)</blockquote>

<h3>The Widow's Ghost</h3>
<blockquote>I was just an old widow, in the world all alone<br>
All I had left was a farm and my home<br>
Tending the land, so to reap what I'd sown<br>
I felt more pain that I'd care to know<br>
<br>
I had a husband and we had a son<br>
Both killed from the blast of the Union guns<br>
My skin, it turned dark, in the Georgia sun<br>
And your fades to gray when the work's never done<br>
<br>
When you've got nothing left you just do what you can<br>
The war was a darkness my heart could not stand<br>
I bought me a rifle to hold in my hands<br>
And killed any damn Yankee who stepped on my land<br>
<br>
I could hear them a-coming 'cross the valley below<br>
Singing bully of the soldier, it's <a href="https://mudcat.org/@displaysong.cfm?SongID=9379,9379&SongID=9379,9379">Billy Barlow</a><br>
I fired my gun as they raided the ford<br>
They froze in the water as they heard the retort<br>
<br>
I wept in the clay as the shots, they let go<br>
It tore through my body while freeing my soul<br>
From the sea to Atlanta, when the sun's sinking low<br>
You can still hear my singing old Billy Barlow<br>
<br>
Oh, I'm rough, I well know<br>
But a bully of a soldier was Billy Barlow<br>
Oh, I'm rough, I well know<br>
Well, a bully of a soldier was Billy Barlow<br>
Oh, I'm rough, I well know<br>
But bully of a soldier was Billy Barlow<br>
Oh, I'm rough, I well know<br>
Well, a bully of a soldier is Billy Barlow</blockquote>

<h3>Wildfire</h3>
<blockquote>Brave men fought with the battle cry<br>
Tears filled the eyes of their loved ones and their brothers in arms<br>
And so it went, for Joseph Warren<br>
It should have been different<br>
It could have been easy<br>
His rank could have saved him<br>
But a country unborn needs bravery<br>
And it spread like wildfire<br>
<br>
Wildfire<br>
<br>
From the ashes grew sweet liberty<br>
Like the seeds of the pines when the forest burns<br>
They open up to grow and burn again<br>
It should have been different<br>
It could have been easy<br>
But too much money rolled in to ever end slavery<br>
The cry for war spread like wildfire<br>
<br>
Wildfire<br>
Wildfire<br>
<br>
Civil War came, Civil War went<br>
Brother fought the brother, the South was spent<br>
But its true demise was hatred passed down through the years<br>
It should have been different<br>
It could have been easy<br>
But pride has a way of holding too firm to history<br>
And it burns like wildfire<br>
<br>
Wildfire<br>
Wildfire<br>
<br>
I was a born a southern son<br>
In a small southern town where the rebels run wild<br>
They beat their chests and they swear we're going to rise again<br>
It should have been different<br>
It could have been easy<br>
The day that old Warren died hate should have gone with him<br>
But here we are caught in the wildfire<br>
<br>
Wildfire<br>
Wildfire<br>
Wildfire<br>
Wildfire</blockquote>

<h3>Willie Boy</h3>
<blockquote><i>I'm not actually sure this song is diretly related to the Civil War, but I've left it here nonetheless</i><br>
<br>
Alabama home, and the dirt where daddy broke his back in labor<br>
Working for the man, white folks they all live high on the hog<br>
Oh, Willie's seventeen and people shake their heads when he goes by<br>
Acts just like a man and the only friend he's got, a one-eyed dog<br>
<br>
Woah, look out Willie boy, don't raise your head so high<br>
Big man gonna get you bye and bye<br>
<br>
Woah, lock him in the jail, oh, the way he walks, it makes my blood run angry<br>
He's a-living with a girl, skin as white as snowfall on the hill<br>
So the sherriff come around, but when he kicked the dog, well, Willie's mind went crazy<br>
Left him on the ground, the white man that he didn't mean to kill<br>
<br>
Woah, look out Willie boy, done laid a white man down<br>
Big man gonna get you bye and bye<br>
<br>
Woah, third day on the road, Willie heard the hound dogs all a-calling<br>
Made him think of home and he clear forgot what he was running for<br>
Knealed down by the road just like he was somewhere years ago<br>
One shot brought him down just as he was reaching for the dog<br>
<br>
Woah, look out Willie boy, don't raise your head so low<br>
Big man gonna get you bye and bye<br>
<br>
They laid him in the ground, just a muddy hole, the boy don't get no preacher<br>
No stone marked the grave, no man come on Sunday there to mourn<br>
Well, the story's back in town how Willie boy he wouldn't run no more<br>
There where Willie lies, a one-eyed dog, he cries to nearly dawn<br>
<br>
Woah, look out Willie boy, don't raise your head so high<br>
Big man gonna get you bye and bye<br>
Big man gonna get you bye and bye</blockquote>

<h3>Wishing</h3>
<blockquote>I wish I could see my home in Georgia<br>
And the pine trees in the rolling red clay hills<br>
Instead of Union troops and their dirty coats of blue<br>
Forming up to cross the field<br>
<br>
And I wish I could hear the crickets<br>
Or the crackling of the homefires like before<br>
Instead I hear the rattle of the muksets<br>
And the deadly cannon's roar<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
I shouldn't waste my time a-wishin'<br>
While it's rainin' shell and shot<br>
'Cause all this wishing can't help me<br>
But right now, wishing's all I got<br>
<br>
I wish I could smell honeysuckle<br>
Or fields of freshly cut hay<br>
Instead of the smoke, the dirt and the fear of dying<br>
In this God-forsaken place<br>
<br>
Oh, the sweat from my brow, gun powder on my lips<br>
And the bitter taste that this war brings<br>
Is a far cry from momma's table back home<br>
And one cool drink from her spring<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
'Cause all this wishing can't help me<br>
But right now, wishing's all I got<br>
Like it or not, this wishing's all I got</blockquote>

<h3>Won't You Come Along and Go</h3>
<blockquote>Jeff Davis rides a white horse, Lincoln rides a mule<br>
Jeff Davis is the president, Lincoln, he's a fool<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
Jeff Davis has a bully cow, Lincoln's got a calf<br>
Jeff Davis's is a full blood, Lincoln's is a half<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Won't you come along and go, won't you come along and go?<br>
Your country is a-calling, can't you hear the bugles blow<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
<br>
The Yankees were a-bragging til they got to Bully Run<br>
Jeff Davis fired a pistol and you oughta seen 'em run<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
Old Abe has got his dander up, he's gonna try again<br>
Jeff Davis is a-laughin' 'cause he knows we're gonna win<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
Price is on the bivouac, Shelby's by his side<br>
We've got our horses saddled and we're gonna take a ride<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
Get ya some tobacco and shoulder up your gun<br>
We're going to Missouri just to see the Yankees run<br>
Won't you come along and go?<br>
<br>
CHORUS</blockquote>

<h3>The Yellow Rose Of Texas</h3>
<blockquote>You may talk about your Beauregard<br>
And sing of General Lee<br>
But the gallant Hood of Texas<br>
Played hell in Tennessee</blockquote>

<h3>Young Rebel Soldier</h3>
<blockquote>He started into the sunset, tears rolled down his face<br>
You could tell he was just a kid who missed his old homeplace<br>
<br>
A duty now had called him to join the boys in gray<br>
Go and fight that Civil War we talk about today<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
No more singing dixie songs, no more playing Soldiers' Joy<br>
Rebel flags are flying now for one more Dixie boy<br>
<br>
At dawn one Sunday morning, near the Mason-Dixon line<br>
Three hungry rebel soldiers were trapped behind the line<br>
They heard one Yankee leader say "We'll check their southern pride<br>
But when the smoke and fighting cleared, ten Yankee soldiers died<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
At the Battle of Atlanta some Yankee shot him down<br>
The southern sun was setting as he lay there on the ground<br>
His old homeplace was calling, he knew his race had run<br>
One more bugle sounding taps for one more rebel son<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
<br>
The Rebel flags are flying now for one more Dixie boy</blockquote>
