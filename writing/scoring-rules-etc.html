		<td class="invisible">"Distance apart" refers to the width of the uppermost part of modern goal posts; originally, these were simply two bars in the ground, and later developed into an H shape.  The H shape steadily fell out of favor after "offset" goalposts were legalized in 1924.  Offset goalposts looked akin to more modern "slingshot" shaped goal posts.  A few schools still use the H-styled posts--most notably LSU, FSU, and Washington State.</td>

Eliminated "punt-out" and "try-at-goal" techniques used from 1877-1921.  When the runner crossed the goal line before 1922, they would mark with their foot the spot they broke the goal line.  From there, the team had two choices to score: first, the team could perform a "try-at-goal," which allowed the ball to be brought out in a straight line from where the mark was to whatever spot the kicker preferred along that line.  In doing this play, the ball would be held for a placekick, and the defense had to position themselves behind the goal line until the ball touched the ground.  The second choice was the "punt-out" (sometimes called the kick out; not to be confused with the play used after a touchback by the same name), which was normally only used if the touchdown was uncomfortably close to the sideline.  To do this, the runner who made the touchdown would drop back behind the goal line and punt the ball to a team mate who was waiting on the other side of the goal posts.  That second team mate had to signal for a fair catch and mark the spot he caught the ball with his heel.  By doing this, the team who scored the touchdown could improve their chances of scoring points after the touchdown.  The risk of the punt-out was that if the fair catch failed, the team punting out forfeited their ability to earn more points on the play.</td>
