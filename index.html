<p>Before creating this website, I put my work on various places around the internet.  Here's a listing of some of the articles which I'm more proud of.  I've organized them by approximate date of 'first' "publication," but these are approximate, as they are on open forum websites that I worked on over time.  Since early 2023, I've also accumulated some writings on this homepage that were not published elsewhere.</p>

		<li><i>NOTE: I quit doing the baseball writeups after a couple of weeks.  I wasn't watching most of the games, which made the act of summarizing the weeks' action difficult; it often devolved into a sort of play-by-play rather than anything interesting or insightful.</i></li>
