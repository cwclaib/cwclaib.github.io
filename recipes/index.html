<p>One other hobby of mine is to find interesting local recipes by buying older cookbooks; below are some recipes I've written down because I found them interesting.  Note that I haven't tried all of them; since many of these recipes are old or antique and precede modern food standards, use your judgment before you consume anything.  I have tried to notate recipes I have tried with an asterisk (*).</p>
