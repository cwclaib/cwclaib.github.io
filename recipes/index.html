<p>One other hobby of mine is to find interesting local recipes by buying older cookbooks; below are some recipes I've written down because I found them interesting.  Note that I haven't tried all of them; since many of these recipes are old or antique and precede modern food standards, use your judgment before you consume anything.  I have tried to notate recipes I have tried with an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>Any commentary preceding or following the recipes is from the source from which the recipes come, unless otherwise noted, and is generally included to help explain the recipe or give an indication of its origins.  In general, I try to keep my commentary to a minimum.</p>
