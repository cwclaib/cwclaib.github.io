<p>This recipe has been handed down by word of mouth. My mother, Mrs. Neill McKimmon, Flora McNeill McEachern, who lives in Red Springs, North Carolina, often uses it, and my family likes it too. It was passed to her by her mother, Mrs. John H. McEachern, who was Miss Mary Ann McNeill before marriage. This lady, my grandmother, was grown and had already finished at old Floral College when the Civil War began.</p>

<p>It is nice made the day before needed, put into baking dish, and re-heated for serving</p>
