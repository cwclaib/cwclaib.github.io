	<h2>Cheese Grit Casserole - Sides and Sauces</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>1 cup water</li>
	<li>3/4 cup quick cooking grits</li>
	<li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
	<li>1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese, grated</li>
	<li>3 tbsp butter/margarine</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp ground red pepper</li>
	<li>6-8 oz cooked ham, finely diced</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
	<li>In a large saucepan, bring milk and water to a boil over medium heat</li>
	<li>Once boiling, stir in grits and bring to a boil again</li>
	<li>Once boiling, reduce heat to medium low and let simmer for 5-7 minutes (or until thick).  Stir occasionally</li>
	<li>Once thickened, remove from heat and add eggs, cheese, butter, salt, and ground red pepper -- stir until well blended</li>
	<li>Lastly, add ham</li>
	<li>Pour food into a greased 1-1/2 - quart baking dish and bake for 30-40 minutes or until top is set and lightly puffed</li>
</ol>

<p>This recipe originally called for just 4 oz of ham, sliced, but that felt much too skimpy the first time I tried it.  The second time around, I did 8 oz and it was much better in my opinion.</p>
