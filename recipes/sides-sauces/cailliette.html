<p>(Stuffed Cabbage or Swiss Chards)</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Large cabbage or Swiss chard leaves</li>
	<li>3 cups stale bread crumbs</li>
	<li>1 cup grated Cheddar or Swiss cheese</li>
	<li>1 cup warm sweet (whole) milk</li>
	<li>2 eggs slightly beaten</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
	<li>Dash of nutmeg</li>
	<li>Chicken or beef broth</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Prepare cabbage or Swiss chard leaves by slicing off thick ribs of leaves, being careful not to break the leaves. Pour boiling water over leaves and let stand until pliable.</li>
	<li>Pour the warm milk over bread crumbs, add eggs, cheese, and seasoning. Mix well.</li>
	<li>Place one heaping tablespoon of the mixture on each leaf. Fold in sides first; then roll and fasten with toothpick or tie with string.</li>
	<li>Drop in boiling broth and boil gently for 1/2 hour or until leaf is cooked tender.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of boiling, these may be placed in a covered baking dish, covered with tomato sauce and baked slowly until tender.</p>

<p>A substitute for the cheese would be one cup of sausage and only one egg. This should be cooked in the broth rather than baked.</p>
