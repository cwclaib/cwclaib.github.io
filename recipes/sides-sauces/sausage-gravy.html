	<h2>Sausage Gravy - Sides and Sauces</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1-2 lbs ground sausage</li>
	<li>1.5 tsp butter</li>
	<li>3 cups whole milk</li>
	<li>3 tbsp of flour</li>
	<li>Salt and Pepper</li>
	<li>6 cooked biscuits</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Heat a large skillet on high.</li>
	<li>Once skillet is hot, place the sausage in the pan and cook until done. </li>
	<li>While cooking, use a large metal spatula to press down on the sausage to help get some of the extra fat out of the meat. </li>
	<li>Right before the sausage is ready place three pats of butter about 1/2 a teaspoon or so each into the skillet with the sausage. </li>
	<li>Place 3 cups of whole milk into the microwave for about two minutes. (this makes sure that the milk wonâ€™t curdle when added to the sausage)</li>
	<li>Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of flour over sausage.</li>
	<li>Add warm milk, 1 cup at a time, stirring after each cup of milk is added.  Bring mixture to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. </li>
	<li>Once you reduce the heat if the gravy is not as thick as you want you can add 1/2 teaspoon of flour at a time stirring after each one is added. </li>
	<li>Salt and pepper to taste and let simmer for about 10-12 minutes.  Pour over biscuits and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
