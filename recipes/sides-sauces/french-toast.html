	<h2>French Toast - Sides and Sauces</h2>
</center>

<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 cup milk</li>
	<li>2 eggs, slightly beaten</li>
	<li>6 slices of bread*</li>
	<li>salt</li>
	<li>granulated sugar and cinnamon, mixed</li>
	<li>fat or shortening</li>
</ul>

<p>* do not use fresh bread unless that is all that is available. If the bread is a week or ten days old... great!</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cut slices of bread in half.** Combine eggs, milk and flour. Dip each slice of bread quickly into the mixture, be sure both sides are covered.</li>
	<li>Brown bread in hot fat... I like about 1/2 to 1/2 inch of Crisco or Jewel shortening.</li>
	<li>While slices are cooking on second side, sprinkle with a little salt.</li>
	<li>When brown, remove from pan with a long fork or small, slotted egg turner and let drain on paper (I prefer using a paper bag rather than a paper towel).</li>
	<li>Place cooked slices on a cookie sheet, sprinkle with a little granulated sugar mixed with cinnamon.</li>
	<li>Place cinnamon-sugar covered slices under the broiler in your oven just long enough for the sugar to melt and form a glaze, watch constantly to prevent burning.</li>
	<li>Remove from oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar.</li>
</ol>
