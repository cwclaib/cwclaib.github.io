	<h2>Brandy Sauce - Sides and Sauces</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 egg yolks</li>
	<li>1/2 cup + 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream</li>
	<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
	<li>between 2 tsp and  tbsp brandy</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Whisk the egg yolks, cream and sugar in a pot over low heat. Do not stop whisking and keep the heat low so that the custard doesn't curdle. Don't worry if it does, there's an easy fix.*</li>
	<li>Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and becomes a sauce. (If you want to serve this to young children, remove some and add a drop of vanilla.) Add the brandy to your liking, from two teaspoonfuls to two tablespoonfuls (or more), but be careful not to add too much brandy or the sauce will become too runny. I used two tablespoonfuls.</li>
	<li>Whisk well so that the sauce is completely smooth</li>
</ol>

<p>* If you did happen to get any lumps or curdled sauce, simply us an immersion blender, or small blender to make the sauce smooth</p>
