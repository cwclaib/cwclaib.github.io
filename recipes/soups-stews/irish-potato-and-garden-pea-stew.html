</center>

<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 cups fresh tender garden peas</li>
	<li>1 quart new white potatoes (about 1 inch diameter)</li>
	<li>1-1/2 cups diced cured ham</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp salt (amount depends on salt in ham)</li>
	<li>1 cup flour</li>
	<li>1 tbsp shortening</li>
	<li>About 2 or 3 tbsp water*</li>
</ul>

<p>* Amount depends on kind of flour as some flour absorbs more water than others

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Put the peas, potatoes, ham, and salt in a pot together with enough water to completely cover vegetables. Cook until about half done.</li>
	<li>Mix flour and shortening together.</li>
	<li>Add water a little at the time until dough is a good texture for rolling.  Roll to about 1/4 inch thick</li>
	<li>Cut the pastry into small pieces, add to the vegetables and cook until done.</li>
	<li>(A sprinkle of black pepper may be added if desired)</li>
</ol>

<p>The recipe below [above] has been used in our family as long as I can remember. To me this recipe is one of the family favorites. My mother used it when all the family was together because she could always stretch the first enw vegetables until there would be enough to serve the whole family. If you have a small family and have just enough of these vegetables for the family dinner and company comes unexpectedly it is a good recipe for stretching the dinner.</p>
