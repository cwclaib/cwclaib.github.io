	<h2>Halifax County Cold Day Soup - Soups and Stews</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 qts water</li>
	<li>1 large cracked soup bone</li>
	<li>1/2 lbs stew beef</li>
	<li>3 slices of bacon, or 3 tbsp drippings</li>
	<li>2 16-oz can tomatoes, undrained</li>
	<li>1 medium head of cabbage</li>
	<li>6 large carrots</li>
	<li>6 large onions</li>
	<li>6 stalks celery, with leaves</li>
	<li>4 medium Irish potatoes</li>
	<li>salt to taste</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Cook bacon (or heat bacon drippings) and brown beef in bacon drippings</li>
	<li>Place bone and beef in cold water, using an 8 qt pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer (Long, slow cooking is necessary)</li>
	<li>Using blender or food processor, puree the tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, onions, and celery -- if using a blender, add boiling water as needed to help puree)</li>
	<ol>
		<li>NOTE: In my opinion, this recipe is better if the cabbage, carrots, and celery are chopped rather than pureed</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Add pureed vegetables to soup pot</li>
	<li>Puree potatoes and set aside</li>
	<li>After pot has simmered for about 2 hours, remove bones and meat pieces with slotted spoon. Discard bone and chop meat into small pieces and return to pot</li>
	<li>Stir very frequently, add salt and sugar, and then simmer soup for 1 more hour</li>
	<li>Add pureed potatoes and continue to stir frequently; cook 1/2-to-1 hour on low heat (potatoes will thicken soup rapidly)</li>
</ol>

<p>Yields 2 gallons -- freezes well</p>
