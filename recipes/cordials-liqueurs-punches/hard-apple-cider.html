<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Large wooden barrel, or glass/plastic jug</li>
	<li>Pure apple juice - no preservative</li>
	<li>Sugar</li>
	<li>Wine yeast</li>
	<li>Fermentation lock</li>
	<li>Siphoning Hose</li>
	<li>Stirring Stick</li>
	<li>Container for bottling</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Fill fermentation container with pure apple juice.</li>
	<li>Within a few hours from time of filling container, remove a sufficient amount of juice by siphoning to make room for sugar.</li>
	<li>Add from 1 to 2 pounds of sugar per gallon depending on taste. The smaller additions of sugar produces a dry hard cider while the greater amount produces a sweeter finished product.</li>
	<li>Stir with a stick to mix sugars with juice. The sugar may not all dissolve at this time. This will not be a problem.</li>
	<li>Fill container to top with some of the juice that was removed and stir again.</li>
	<li>Place container in its permanent location and do not move again. The idea location is dark and cool, but any place that will not freeze will do.</li>
	<li>Place something under the container to catch spillage and overflow during the fermentation process.</li>
	<li>Prepare and add wine yeast according to directions on the yeast package.</li>
	<li>Install the fermentation lock in the container opening. The lock will allow the carbon dioxide gas, generated by the fermentation process, to escape and keep the oxygen, which is harmful, from entering.</li>
	<li>Within about a week the juice will begin to work (boil and froth) quite vigorously for about two weeks.It will be less active during the balance of the fermentation period.</li>
	<li>One month after all fermentation ceases your hard cider is ready to be drawn off. The fermentation period could take from two to eight months depending on the conditions.</li>
	<li>Tape the siphoning hose to the stirring stick with the end of the hose just above the sediment in the bottom o.i the container.</li>
	<li>Remove fermentation lock and insert stick and hose into container. Siphon cider into jugs or bottles as desired.</li>
	<li>Bottle all cider except for the bottom few ounces; this contains sediment which should be discarded.</li>
	<li>Wash fermentation container for reuse again next year.</li>
</ol>
