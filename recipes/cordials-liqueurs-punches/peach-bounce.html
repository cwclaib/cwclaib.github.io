</center>

<br>
<p>(The recipe is formatted for cherry bounce, since that is the way I first came across it, however peach bounce is my preference)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 pound cherries, stemmed</li>
	<ul><li>Bing cherries will be sweet, others tart</li></ul>
	<li>2 cups sugar</li>
	<li>4 cups bourbon (peach) or vodka (cherry) (or rum, cognac, etc.)</li>

</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pierce each cherry with the tip of a knife in 1 or 2 places.</li>
	<li>Combine the sugar and 1 cup of vodka in a 1/2 gal. jar and shake to dissolve sugar.</li>
	<li>Add fruit, then shake again, then top with vodka.</li>
	<li>Shake gently to distribute the fruit.</li>
	<li>Place the jar in a sunny indoor spot; let it sit for 1 week, then transfer it to a dark spot and let it sit for 40 days. The color of the bounce will darken/intensify.</li>
	<li>Seat a strainer over a pitcher or container with a pour spout. Strain the cherry mixture; reserve or discard the fruit.</li>
	<li>Cover the strained liquor and let it settle for a few hours, then pour the bounce into a clean 1-quart jar</li>
	<li>NOTE: peach bounce: choose bourbon. Add a dozen coin-size slices of fresh ginger root. Peel and chop the peaches before infusing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Serves 16</p>


<p>I've made both the cherry and peach version of this bounce recipe; the peach is fair and away my favorite.  The ginger works very well with the peach and bourbon flavors.  The cherry one is good but can taste a bit medicinal.  I used about half bing cherries and half was Ranier cherries for the cherry bounce, and used all yellow peaches for the peach bounce.</p>
