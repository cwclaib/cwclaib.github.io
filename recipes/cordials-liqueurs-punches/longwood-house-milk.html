<p>This lovely white frame house with its rolling lawn serves as the home of the President of Longwood College in Farmville. It was built in 1815 and is the site of the birthplace of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. Having once been a tea room where students, faculty and townspeople could meet, it now serves as the scene of many college functions. Thus its charm and beauty have been shared by many young ladies during their scholarly pursuits at this traditional Virginia school.</p>
