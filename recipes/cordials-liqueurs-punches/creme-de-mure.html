	<h2>Creme de Mure - Cordials, Liqueurs, &amp Punches</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 cups blackberries*, washed and de-stemmed</li>
    <li>1  bottle of red wine, medium bodied (standard size, 750 mL)</li>
    <li>1.5 cups sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vodka/gin</li>
</ul>
<p>*~78 blackberries, or just over 2 pint containers<br>
(1 cup = 15-16 blackberries, each container holds 30-32 blackberries)</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Put the blackberries in a large glass or ceramic bowl and pour over red wine.  Then mash the berries using a fork or potato masher to release the berries</li>
	<li>Cover with a clean towel and leave to macerate for 48 hours in a cool place (fridge) - give the berries a little mash every now and then if you remember!</li>
	<li>Strain through a wire mesh sieve to remove the berries, then strain again through cheese cloth to ensure all seeds etc are out.</li>
	<li>Pour into a large saucepan and add the sugar (1-½ cups). Bring to a gentle simmer on a medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Simmer for 8 minutes.</li>
	<li>Remove from heat and stir in the vodka or gin (½ cup), and then leave to cool completely</li>
	<li>Pour into clean, preferably sterilized, bottles and store in cool, dark place. It can be enjoyed immediately, but will keep almost indefinitely if in sterilized bottles - if not, then about a year.</li>
</ol>
