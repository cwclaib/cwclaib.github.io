<p>Long ago a French caterer in Lexington, Kentucky made a wonderful white cake in honor of his countryman, Lafayette, who was to pay a visit to the city. The cake was beautifully decorated with flags made of colored sugar and with marvelous icing, but the cake itself contained only the whites of eggs, and when cut was snow-white. Thereupon every famous cake baker in the Blue-Grass region immediately began making white cakes; and the recipe for the most famous of all was originated in the household of the ancestors of Mary Todd, who many years afterward made the cake for Abraham Lincoln. Later when she became his wife, he declared this white cake was the best in Kentucky. Here is Mary Todd's recipe with modern baking powder included.</p>
