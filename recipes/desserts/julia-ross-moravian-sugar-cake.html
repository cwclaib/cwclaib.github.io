<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>

	<li>Beat on medium speed of a mixer for 5 minutes</li>
	<li>With a spoon add the other cup of flour to make a soft dough. Cover and place in a warm spot to rise until doubled in bulk (about 1-1/2 hours)</li>
	<li>Beat down and let rise again if you have time (about 45 minutes)</li>
	<li>Now turn dough into greased baking pan 17” x 11” x 1” and use hands to spread evenly over entire surface. Cover and let rise until light (1 hour)</li>
	<li>When dough is light, brush with cream.</li>
	<li>Combine the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over entire surface of the dough.</li>
	<li>With fingertips make shallow indentations in dough 1” apart</li>
	<li>Sprinkle butter over all. Bake for 15 minutes in a 375 degree oven.</li>
</ol>

<p>Makes 20 generous servings</p>

<h3>(Alternate method for overnight rising)</h3>

<p>Late in the day before you need sugar cake the following day, make dough as above, except use 2 pkgs. yeast. After rising in the bowl once (about 1 hour), stir down, cover with foil and place in refrigerator. A half hour later, punch down because it will have risen again before the dough became sufficiently cool to retard yeast growth. Refrigerate overnight. Next morning, place in pan and let rise until light (about 1-1/2 hours)</p>
