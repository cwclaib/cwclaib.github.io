</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1-1/4 cups water</li>
	<li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
	<li>1/8 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
	<li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
	<li>6 firm peaches, peeled, pitted, and sliced into 8 pieces each</li>
	<li>1/4 cup chopped pecans (optional, garnish)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Batter</li>
	<ol>
		<li>1 cup all purpose flour or gluten-free flour blend
		<li>1 teaspoon baking powder
		<li>heavy pinch kosher salt
		<li>1/2 cup whole milk
		<li>1 stick of butter
		<li>2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
	</ol>
	<li>Peaches</li>
		<li>Mix together the water, brown sugar, spices, and salt and pour into the inner liner of your Instant Pot.
		<li>Turn to saute and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
		<li>Press cancel. If using fresh peaches, let the syrup cool for 20 minutes. If using frozen peaches, add them to the pot, lock the lid in place, making sure it is set to sealing. Set manual pressure for 3 minutes.
		<li>Once the 3 minutes is up, carefully do a quick pressure release then remove the lid.
		<li>Press cancel and then saute. Allow syrup to boil for 3-5 minutes to slightly reduce and thicken the syrup.
		<li>Add pecans if using and pour into a 1 1/2 to 2 quart oval baker.
	</ol>
	<li>Combined</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Set a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350F.
		<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour or gluten-free flour blend, the baking powder, and salt.
		<li>Place milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high power until butter has mostly melted and milk is hot. Stir until butter is completely melted.
		<li>Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir just until you have a thick batter.
		<li>Spoon evenly on top of the hot fruit mixture.
		<li>Sprinkle the batter with the granulated sugar. (See Notes)
		<li>Place the baking dish on a tray to catch any drips and put in the oven. Bake until the topping is deep golden brown and the juices are bubbling all over, about 30-35 minutes.
		<li>Allow sonker to cool for 40 minutes or so and serve warm with ice cream, milk dip, sweetened or unsweetened cream, yogurt, or eat it plain.
		<li>Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and reheat to serve.

<p>The recipe for the spiced peaches is from The Gluten-Free Instant Pot Cookbook by Jane Bonacci and Sara de Leeuw, published by Harvard Common Press, March 2019.</p>

<p>For a sweeter dessert, you can whisk 1/4 cup sugar into the flour, baking powder, and salt. In that case, you can choose to sprinkle additional sugar on top of the batter or not. It all depends on how sweet you like things.</p>
