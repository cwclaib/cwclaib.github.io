</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cake</li>
	<ul>
		<li>1 tbsp (one package) of dry yeast, dissolved in</li>
		<li>1/2 cup lukewarm water</li>
		<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
		<li>2 eggs</li>
		<li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
		<li>2/3 cup shortening</li>
		<li>1 cup hot mashed potatoes</li>
		<li>1 cup scalded milk, cooled to warm</li>
		<li>6-7 cups flour</li>
		<li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Frosting</li>
	<ul>
		<li>1/2 cup flour</li>
		<li>1 lb light brown sugar</li>
		<li>4 tbsp butter</li>
		<li>1 dash cinnamon</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Prep</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
		<li>To proof yeast, add a pinch of sugar to the yeast in lukewarm water (hot water will kill the yeast action). If it foams, it is good.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Cake</li>
	<ol>
		<li>In large mixing bowl, cream eggs, salt, sugar and shortening till smooth.</li>
		<li>Gradually add warm milk and mashed potatoes, stirring a bit. Then add yeast, mixing well. Add flour a cup at a time, until dough is stiff enough to turn out on a floured board.</li>
		<li>Knead dough until soft & spongy (about 10-15 minutes by hand, or if done in a food processor, mix until it forms a ball). Place in large greased bowl in a draft free, warm place & cover with a damp towel. Let dough double in size (approx. 2-3 hours).</li>
		<li>Punch down and divide dough.</li>
		<li>Place in greased pie pans or large cookie sheets (apx. 9x13), cover & let double in size again (approx. 1-1/2 hrs.)</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Topping</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Mix the flour, brown sugar thoroughly</li>
		<li>Spread melted butter on top of cakes, punching holes in dough about 1 inch apart with fingers. Be careful not to punch down to bottom of pan but only half way down to make a wave-like effect.</li>
		<li>Pour topping into holes in the dough.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle remaining crumbs over top & sprinkle with cinnamon.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Bake</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Bake in pre-heated oven at 350 for 20 minutes or until golden & fully baked on the bottom. Serve warm.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
