<p>This recipe is much over 100 years old, being used in the Forney family for generations.</p>
<p>I remember years ago when my brother, James H. Forney, who was then Attorney General of Idaho, brought his wife with him for a visit to our mother, Mrs. Harvey Forney of Rutherford County, North Carolina.</p>
<p>He requested his mother to make a Slight Pudding for a dinner she was giving in honor of him and his wife. Of course, his mother did so. Among the guests were Mrs. Forneyâ€™s niece, Mrs. Mary Forney Nabers and her husband Dr. A. H. Nabers.</p>
