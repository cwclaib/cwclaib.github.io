<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 quart cream</li>
	<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
	<li>8 egg yolks</li>
	<li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
	<li>light brown sugar</li>
	<li>whipped cream (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Heat cream in double boiler until hot but not boiling. Add sugar and stir until dissolved.</li>
	<li>Pour over yolks, well beaten, and add vanilla.</li>
	<li>Put in shallow Pyrex baking dish of the right size to have the custard 1-1/2 inches thick. Place in pan of hot water and bake in slow oven until set.</li>
	<li>Cool and place in refrigerator to chill thoroughly. Then cover the surface with light brown sugar (dark will not do), 1/4 inch thick.</li>
	<li>Place under blazing hot broiler and watch carefully. The top of the sugar should melt leaving a shiny caramel cover.</li>
	<li>When entire surface is glazed, remove from oven and cool. Put back in refrigerator and chill thoroughly.</li>
	<li>Custard must be served ice cold to be good. You may serve it with whipped cream on top.</li>
</ol>
