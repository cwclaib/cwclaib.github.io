<p>Here is a recipe from the kitchen of Mrs. R. A. Holloman, Jr. It was used for many years by the family of her mother, Mrs. H. U. Griffith. This was a favorite dessert with the family with the exception of one uncle who was always heard to say whenever the dish was served, "This dish certainly has the right name because it is trifling."  My mother would always reply with, "Well, the proof of the pudding is in the taste thereof."</p>
