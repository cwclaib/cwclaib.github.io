<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Main Dish:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>~6 small apples (Granny Smith or Jazz)</li>
		<li>~6 thin slices butter</li>
		<li>~1-1/3 cups brown sugar</li>
		<li>1-1/2 lemons, juiced</li>
		<li>1-1/2 cups bread crumbs</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Topping (<a href="../sides-sauces/brandy-sauce.html">Brandy sauce</a>):</li>
	<ul>
		<li>2 egg yolks</li>
		<li>1/2 cup + 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream</li>
		<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
		<li>between 2 tsp and  tbsp brandy</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Main Dish:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Pare, core and slice thin some sour, juicy apples.</li>
		<li>Butter a deep 8x8 baking dish or pan and put in a layer of apples</li>
		<li>Sweeten with brown sugar and flavor with lemon juice</li>
		<li>Strew (scatter/spread) over a layer of bread crumbs and bits of butter; repeat this until dish is nearly full</li>
		<li>Finish with a layer of bread crumbs, bits of butter, and a sprinkle of brown sugar</li>
		<li>Bake til apples are soft</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Topping:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Whisk the egg yolks, cream and sugar in a pot over low heat. Do not stop whisking and keep the heat low so that the custard doesn't curdle. Don't worry if it does, there's an easy fix.*</li>
		<li>Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and becomes a sauce. (If you want to serve this to young children, remove some and add a drop of vanilla.) Add the brandy to your liking, from two teaspoonfuls to two tablespoonfuls (or more), but be careful not to add too much brandy or the sauce will become too runny. I used two tablespoonfuls.</li>
		<li>Whisk well so that the sauce is completely smooth</li>
	</ol>
</ol>

<p>* If you did happen to get any lumps or curdled sauce, simply us an immersion blender, or small blender to make the sauce smooth</p>

<p>My Notes:</p>
<!-- https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/s7gbht/bunglets_aka_pandowdy_from_north_carolina_1860/ -->

<p>I have two antique recipes for a dessert known as a pandowdy, which, after some research, seems to be materially similar to the bunglets which I was originally searching for.  After some research, I decided that the only difference between a bunglet and a pandowdy was only nominal, aside from the semi-optional additionl of either a brandy- or cream-based topping.  Additionally, there is some discrepancy over whether the dish is made dry (as the earlier recipe, <a href="pandowdy.html">Pandowdy</a>, calls for) or with a batter (as the newer, <a href="apple-pan-dowdy.html">Apple Pan Dowdy</a>, describes).  My assumption is that the original dish was a drier dish without the batter, however as times passed and affluence increased, the dish was made with batter, perhaps with inspiration taken from the similar mountain-dish of <a href="lazy-peach-sonker.html">sonkers</a>.</p>

<p>Because of this, I've combined three recipes to arrive at what I feel is a mostlty-authentic representation of what constituted a bunglet in the early 1900s, using a batter-base and brandy sauce as a topping.</p>

Perhaps the same dish as bunglets or also known as Jack Pie?
