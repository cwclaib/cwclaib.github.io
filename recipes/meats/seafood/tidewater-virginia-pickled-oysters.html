<p>This recipe was handed to me by my grandmother, Mrs. Leonard Hyslop, who was Miss Georgeanna Pullen before marriage. It was handed down to Grandmother Hyslop by her grandmother (my great, great grandmother) who reared her. Her own mother having died during the yellow fever epidemic that struck Portsmouth, Virginia, before the Civil War.</p>

<p>** From Pickled Oysters, p. 58, 1 gallon oysters requires 1.5 pints vinegar, so assuming the ratio is similar, you would need 5.25 pints or 21/32 gallons of oysters per pint of vinegar</p>

<!-- 
1 gal = 8 pints

8O = 1.5y
1O = 3/16 y
1y = 16/3 = 5.33 ~= 5.25
