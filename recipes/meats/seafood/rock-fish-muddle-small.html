	<h2>Rock Fish Muddle (Small) - Seafood</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 fish, about 3 lbs - rock fish (striped bass), or other lean, white-fleshed fish, like haddock, red snapper, or whiting</li>
	<li>The Court-Bouillon</li>
	<ul>
		<li>1 fish head</li>
		<li>2 bay leaves</li>
		<li>1 large onion, peeled and sliced</li>
		<li>1 carrot, scraped and cubed</li>
		<li>1 rib celery with leaves, chopped</li>
		<li>7 to 8 peppercorns</li>
		<li>8 drops Tabasco sauce (or more to taste)</li>
		<li>Salt to taste</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The Muddle</li>
	<ul>
		<li>1/4 pound salt pork, approximately, cut in small cubes</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
		<li>6 scallions, chopped fine (including some of the green)</li>
		<li>2 large ribs celery, chopped fine</li>
		<li>4 medium-size potatoes, peeled and finely diced</li>
		<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>Minced fresh parsley and lemon wedges for garnish</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Clean and scale fish, cutting off head and tail. Place the fish, and its head with other ingredients for court-bouillon in a large pot. Cover with cold water and simmer just until meat flakes from bones.</li>
	<li>Remove pot from heat and let cool. Remove fish and pick out all fish bones. Set meat aside. Strain broth, discarding the solids. Return liquid to pot and reduce over high heat to about 1 cup.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, to prepare muddle, heat a large pot over medium heat and put in salt pork and water. When pork cubes are edged with brown and fat is translucent, add chopped scallions and celery and cook until moist and limp.</li>
	<li>Pour in reduced broth and diced potatoes and simmer until potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes. Then gently stir in fish and simmer 10 minutes more, tasting for seasoning, and adding salt and pepper as necessary. Ladle muddle into soup bowls, garnishing servings with minced fresh parsley. Serve at once, accompanied by lemon wedges and griddle cornbread.</li>
</ol>
