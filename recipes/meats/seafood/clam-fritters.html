<p>You can tell by the recipe below that my folks were “coast people.” As far as I know the recipe is much over a hundred years old.</p>

<p>A very, very similar from Mrs. J. R. Mayberry, of Carteret County, includes the following details:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Batter should be thin like pancake batter</li>
	<li>Fry on hot griddle or heavy skillet in shallow grease</li>
	<li>Fritters should be 3-to-4 inches in diameter</li>
</ul>
