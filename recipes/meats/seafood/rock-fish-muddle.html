<p>Handed down by Mr. Harvey Lassiter of Lasker, North Carolina, in 1944. Mr. Lassiter is now deceased. Perhaps this recipe has been used in the town of Lasker for many years since this little town is noted for getting together for feeds.</p>

<p>Note: Northampton County is famous for Rock Muddle since the Roanoke River is so near. This is definitely a Northampton dish. In early spring everyone turns out for county and community "Rock Muddles". It is different from and better than stewed fish.</p>
