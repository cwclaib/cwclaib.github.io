<p>Sea turtle hash is definitely a “he man’s” dish from the briny deep; and this recipe has been handed down in my family of Cape Hatteras fisherman for several generations from the sailing vessel era when men were men, but may be enjoyed without prejudice, by the entire family. My mother prepared it in an old-fashioned, fireplace style, iron pot over a wood fire; and I don’t claim to compete with her for flavor and aroma but my modern pressure cooker certainly saves time.</p>

<p>Take any sea turtle you are lucky enough to get but the following ingredients are for a smaller size sea turtle. If your turtle is too large for one meal, by all means can or freeze it for a future feast.</p>
