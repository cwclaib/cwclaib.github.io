<p>My grandmother, Mrs. Mollie Henley Jonas, who was born March 17, 1851 in Wythe County, Virginia, used the following recipe. My mother, Bessie Jonas Johnson, has used this recipe for 48 years and I have used it for 7 years. We use it mainly for dumplings with stewed chicken but can be used with any meat.</p>
