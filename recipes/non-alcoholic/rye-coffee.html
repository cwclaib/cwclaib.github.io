	<h2>Rye Coffee - Non-Alcoholic Drinks</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>dried rye
	<li>water
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Take rye and boil it, but not so much as to burst the grain</li>
	<li>Then either dry it in the sun, or a stove, or a kiln, after which it is ready for parching, to be used like a real coffee bean</li>
	<li>The rye, when boiled and dried, will keep for any length of time, and consequently can be done at some convenient moment, so as to have it ready whenever wanted for parching</li>
</ol>
