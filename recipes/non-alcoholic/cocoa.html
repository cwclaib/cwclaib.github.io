	<h2>Cocoa - Non-Alcoholic Drinks</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>14 oz milk</li>
	<li>1/2 cup hot chocolate mix</li>
	<li>(optional) Chocolate syrup</li>
	<li>(optional) Whip cream</li>
</ul>

<p>The 14 oz of milk can be any combination of milk and water, but the more milk there is, the richer and better the result is.  My mom originally called for all 14 oz to be milk if using 1% milk, and for it to be 3/4 milk (10.5 oz) and 1/4 water (1.5 oz) if using 2%, but said she stopped doing it some time ago.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add milk and/or water to a heat-safe container which pours well</li>
	<li>Microwave the milk for 1-1/2 minutes on high (power level 10)</li>
	<li>Whisk in the cocoa powder</li>
	<li>Microwage the milk and cocoa for 1-1/2 minutes on high (power level 10)
	<ol type="a"><li>If your milk is warm or seems to be getting to hot, opt for a shorter time or a lower power level for the second half.</li></ol>
	<li>Add chocolate syrup (if desired) and whisk again</li>
	<li>Pour into mugs and top with whip cream and, if you want, more syrup.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you use the instructions on the side of a Nestle cocoa powder container (not hot chocolate mix, but the baking ingredient), just adjust the recipe so that there is still 1/2 a cup of solid powder.  If you're doing a ha1f cup of powder, this means 1/3 a cup of sugar and 1/6 a cup (almost exactly 8 tsp) cocoa.  If you want to do half hot chocolate mix and half cocoa powder if you have, for example, way more cocoa powder than you'll ever use baking (couldn't be me!) you use 1/4 a cup of hot chocolate mix, 1/6 a cup (8 tsp) sugar, and 1/12 a cup (almost exactly 4 tsp) cocoa powder.  Their recipe also calls for vanilla, but I usually omit this as it makes it too sweet.</p>
