<p>It's worth noting that these ingredients don't always scale in a 1:1 ratio.  Maybe it was for convenience reasons (i.e., the No. 1 sized can) or maybe it just scales oddly.  This is how it appeared in the recipe book I transcribed it from.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Simmer 2 cups of cider with spices in a saucepan about 15 minutes.</li>
	<li>Cool and remove spices; chill juices until icy cold.</li>
	<li>Combine ingredients; pour into punch bowl.</li>
	<li>Add a block of ice.  Garnish with thin slices of orange and maraschino cherry halves</li>
</ol>
