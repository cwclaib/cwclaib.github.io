	<h2>Mixed Drinks</h2>
</center>

<br>

<p>Unfortunately, I never bothered very much with noting where I got these mixed drink recipes from, though I have attempted, in retrospect, to track them down.  A lot of them came from a few random mixed drink rolodexes I found; the main one was titled "Bar Aid" and looked like <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-bar-aid-80-cocktail-recipes-1836444115">this</a>, though several came from two shakers with cocktails printed on the sides; the first one was a vintage glass one with no identifying marks but looked like a black on glass version of <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/155303887301095206/">this</a> (called "Glass Cocktail Shaker"), while the other is (I think) the Norpro 446 cocktail shaker.  I bought both at a thrift store. Almost all of the beer-based cocktails came from <i>A Taste of the West from Coors</i> (1981).  Most of the rest come from either random places on the internet; a few were made up by me and my friends.  Several of them have been criticized by some of my friends who know more about cocktails than I do, so take them worth a grain of salt.</p>

<p>At some point I'll attempt to organize these by their style of cocktail at some point, or at the very least format them, but for now they're just in alphabetical order.</p>

   * The  Benromach can be substituted for another smokey and peaty scotch, if necessary. The pipe tobacco should be a somewhat sweeter blend, but not too much so. We used a blend called "winter pudding", which was ideal. To "infuse" the scotch, pour a couple ounces into a mortar and pestle, then a pinch or two of tobacco. Muddle it for a couple minutes, until the scotch changes color, then filter out the tobacco through some paper coffee filters, twice if necessary.
