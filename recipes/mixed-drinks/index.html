	<h2>Mixed Drinks</h2>
</center>

<br>

<p>Unfortunately, I never bothered very much with noting where I got these mixed drink recipes from.  A lot of them came from a few random mixed drink rolodexes I found; the main one was titled "Bar Aid" and looked like <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-bar-aid-80-cocktail-recipes-1836444115">this</a>.  Almost all of the beer-based cocktails came from <i>A Taste of the West from Coors</i> (1981).  Most of the rest come from either random places on the internet; a few were made up by me and my friends.  Several of them have been criticized by some of my friends who know more about cocktails than I do, so take them worth a grain of salt.</p>

<p>At some point I'll attempt to organize these by their style of cocktail at some point, or at the very least format them, but for now they're just in alphabetical order.</p>
