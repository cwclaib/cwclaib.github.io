<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 quart sweet milk</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>7 tbsp meal</li>
	<li>3 tbsp flour</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
	<li>2 tbsp butter</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Beat eggs and stir in meal*, flour, and salt.</li>
	<li>Bring milk to boil and add to egg mixture gradually.</li>
	<li>Cook in sauce pan until it thickens a little, stirring constantly.</li>
	<li>Pour into hot casserole dish that has the butter melted in it. Bake at 350 degrees until brown.</li>
</ol>

<p>* This is a correction from an assumed typo in the original recipe; the original recipe said to "Beat eggs and stir in milk, flour, and salt. Bring milk to boil and add to egg mixture gradually."
