<p>Source: I failed to note where exactly this recipe came from, however it was from somewhere in the <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/findingaids/ua102_050/">McDowell County Extension Homemakers</a> papers; I don't believe it was the same <i>Holiday House Cookbook</i> that many of the other recipes came from.</p>
