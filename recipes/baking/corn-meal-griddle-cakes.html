	<h2>Corn-Meal Griddle Cakes - Baking</h2>
</center>

<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 cup corn meal</li>
	<li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
	<li>2 cups boiling water</li>
	<li>1-1/2 cups milk</li>
	<li>2 cups flour</li>
	<li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>2 eggs, well beaten</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Put meal, sugar, and salt into mixing bowl and pour over them the boiling water.</li>
	<li>Let stand until the meal swells; then add the cold milk.</li>
	<li>When the mixture is quite cool, stir in the flour and baking powder, mixing well, and lastly add the eggs, well beaten.</li>
	<li>Bake on a hot griddle.  The cakes should be small, well browned, and thoroughly cooked; they need a little longer cooking than wheat griddle cakes.</li>
</ol>
