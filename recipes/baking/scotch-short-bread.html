	<h2>Scotch Short Bread - Baking</h2>
</center>

<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1/2 lb butter</li>
	<li>2-3/4 cup flour</li>
	<li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cream butter; add sugar slowly, then flour, 2 tbsp at a time.</li>
	<li>Knead until smooth. Pat out a small amount at a tine and cut with a small cookie cutter, or shape into roll or block, chill, and slice off.</li>
	<li>Bake at 400 degrees until a very delicate brown. Do not overcook.</li>
</ol>

<p>This short bread is very much like commercial Lorna Doones. It is rich and so good it melts in your mouth.</li>
