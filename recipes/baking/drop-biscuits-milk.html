	<h2>Drop Biscuits (Milk/Buttermilk) - Baking</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 cups all-purpose flour
	<li>1 tbsp baking powder
	<li>1-1/4 tsp kosher salt
	<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (8 tbsp, 1 stick) -- cold
	<li>3/4 - to - 1 cup of milk or buttermilk
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 450 F
	<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Optionally, add herbs.</li>
	<li>Cut the cold butter into small pieces and cut into the chunks with a fork or pastry cutter until the mix reaches a coarse consistency.  You can add cheeses here before adding milk</li>
	<li>Add milk and stir until just combined.  If the batter is dry, you can add more.  DO NOT OVERMIX -- the batter will be quite lumpy</li>
	<li>Drop large mounds of the mix on a baking sheet (about 1/4 cup each)</li>
	<li>Bake at 450 for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown</li>
	<li>Brush with melted butter</li>
</ol>
