<p>Instead of a tin and yellow sugar, a mixing bowl and white sugar may be substituted</p>

<p>Iâ€™m fifty-three years old and as far back as I can remember both my grandmothers made this bread. If a neighbor was sick I knew a pone of this bread would be baked and sent to the sick neighbor. It would keep several days.</p>

<p>When I asked my grandmother Clayton who taught her to make the bread she said, "My mother taught me and for generations back each mother showed her daughters how to make this very bread."</p>

<p>I asked grandmother Evans and she said, "Law, Honey, your great, great, great grandmother came from Holland; she taught her daughter and it was handed down from generation to generation."</p>

<p>This bread was cooked in a skillet on the hearth by old women.</p>
