<p>This recipe is from the kitchen of Mrs. James L. Houser, who lives on the Green River Plantation, which is located in both Rutherford and Polk Counties.</p>

<p>Green River House was built in 1804, and the brick used in it was brought from Charleston, South Carolina, by wagons and was built by the slaves.</p>

<p>During the war between the states, Northern soldiers, on their march through the South, stabled their horses in the drawing room of the Green River House, where the hoof prints are still visible.</p>

<p>This recipe was used extensively at the Green River House and was given to me by one of the old cooks who used it quite often.</p>
