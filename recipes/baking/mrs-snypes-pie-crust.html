<br>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 cups Red Band flour</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1/3 cup butter</li>
	<li>1/3 cup Crisco</li>
	<li>4 tbsp ice water</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mix salt with flour. Cut in butter and crisco until shortening is in pieces not larger than peas.</li>
	<li>Pour into ice water and stir with fork until mixture is dampened.</li>
	<li>Roll in ball, wrap in waxed paper, and chill thoroughly.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this crust is baked slower and longer than usual, it will be more satisfactory for a pie that is to be refrigerated for any length of time.</p>
