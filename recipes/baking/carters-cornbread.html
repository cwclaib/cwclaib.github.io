	<h2>Carter's Cornbread - Baking</h2>
</center>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dry ingredients:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>1 C corn flour (not wheat flour)</li>
		<li>1 C corn meal</li>
		<li>1/2 tbsp salt</li>
		<li>1 and a 1/4 tbsp baking powder</li>
		<li>1/2 tbsp baking soda</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Wet ingredients</li>
	<ul>
		<li>1 C corn</li>
		<li>1 C buttermilk (at room temperature)</li>
		<li>2 eggs at room temperature</li>
		<li>1/4 C unsalted butter (If you use salted butter, cut the dry ingredient salt to 1/4 from 1/2 tbsp)</li>
		<li>1/4 C white sugar</li>
		<li>1/4 C brown sugar</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mix the dry ingredients, then the wet ingredients.</li>
	<li>Then pour the dry into the wet and mix.</li>
	<li>Use a 9" x 9" baking pan and use butter to lube the pan. Note that the pan needs to have sides that are as vertical as possible, not slanted. (It makes a big difference in the final thickness of the ingredients)</li>
	<li>Put pan into a preheated 400 F oven. Use the middle rack and bake for about 23 minutes--keep an eye on it starting at 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Primarily based on the recipe from <i>Foods That Rate at NC State</i> (<a href="cornbread.html">link</a>), this variation was written in collaboration with a friend, B.M., who would prefer to remain anonymous.  The excellent commentary and notes are his doing, as is the name.  He also suggested using a ratio of baking powder to soda that was closer to 1:1.</p>
