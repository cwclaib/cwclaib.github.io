<p>This recipe dates back four generations to Civil War days. It was always made and served on Shrove Tuesday in our family. Tradition was that this was mandatory if one wished to have success growing cabbage that year. Also some must be fed the hens to assure heavy laying that year. At our hours the hens was fed only in token portions.</p>

<p>Fastnachts are delicious served hot with fruit preserve  and coffee or with a salad course.</p>
