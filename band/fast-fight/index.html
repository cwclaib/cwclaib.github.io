<h2>Fast Fight</h2>
</center>

<p>"Fast Fight" is an NC State pep band tradition dating back several years.  During the second-to-last media time out of each home men's and women's basketball game, the trumpet section takes the court, running to both of the sidelines (bounded by the throw-in lines) and also usually the endline opposite the band, if time permits.  As the 5-minute mark of the final period approaches, the trumpets gather in the corner beneath the bleachers where the band sits.  Once the timeout is called, the drum set plays a spastic melody as the trumpets run out on each side, with one or two more experienced section members (depending on size of the section that day; chosen on an ad-hoc basis) taking a knee in front of the group selected to count the group off.  While on the sides, the trumpets play a short tune which usually has two short downward-modulating tunes, followed by two short upward-modulating tunes.  During the downward-modulating sections, the student section claps along to the beat, and during the upward-modulating ones, the students clap and say "woo!" on the peak of the modulation.  While all this is going on, the cheerleaders get on each others shoulders and run along but behind the trumpets, with the uppermost cheerleader moving their pom-poms with the students.</p>

<p>After that, the band goes to the corner they started in and plays slow fight the same way as before all basketball and football games: once with only the trumpets, playing slowly at first but accelerating exponentially as the song goes on, followed by a second repitition with the entire band joining in.  During this part, the student section claps along in rhythm, clapping with themselves once followed by a shared clap with whoever is on their left or right side.</p>

<p>Here are a few videos of the fast fight in action.</p>

<p>A short snippet of a performance from the 1987.  Note that the cheerleaders are standing in front of the band.  You can't hear it well, but the trumpets are clearly playing a different tune than the modern one.</p>

<p>Snippet of a performance from the 11/11/2005 exhibition men's game vs Mt. Olive.  This clip shows a different ending format, with the band lining up along the baseline rather than in the corner.</p>

<p>Most of a performance from the 12/9/2006 men's game vs Savannah State.  Note that the band only plays on two sides, as mentioned by the videographer.</p>

<p>A two-sided rendition of "Fast Fight" from the 1/12/2012 women's game vs Boston College, which does a good job showing the non-trumpet band members.  This version largely predates the partner-clapping described above, though two trombone players are doing it.</p>

<p>"Fast Fight" at a 2/16/2014 women's game vs North Carolina.  Note that a few more members of the band are doing the partner-clapping.</p>

<p>This video shows how travel bands perform Fast Fight at tournaments; this example is from the 3/13/2014 game vs Miami in Greensboro at the men's ACC Tournament.  At tournaments, the band can't take the court and is confined to a relatively small box and given less time than usual, forcing several changes from the usual tradition.</p>

<p>A 12/10/2016 performance from the men's Heritage Game in vs Tennessee State in Reynolds Coliseum ran short on time -- note the buzzer going off while trumpets are still on the court, and the rapid pace of "slow" fight afterwards.</p>

<p>An unidentified performance from the 2021-22 basketball season, from two women's game at Reynolds Coliseum.  This video does a good job of showing what the non-trumpet band members do.</p>

<p>Legend passed down from members of Mu Beta Psi allege that this tradition started when the basketball coach (WHICH?) complained that the fight song was too quick and unremarkable, and that we needed something faster to get the students into the game; in response, the trumpet section played the first song as fast as possible.  From there, it has gradually devolved into some unrecognizable short trills up and down.</p>
