<h2>The History of Waldo</h2>
</center>

<p>Waldo is a NCSU Pep Band trumpet section tradition dating back to circa 2011.  Here is his history as given to me by his first owner, Michelle Parker-Van Dyke:</p>

<blockquote>"Waldo came into my possession sometime in either fall of 2011 or early spring of 2012. The attached photo [below] is from the first game where we got Waldo. That was the first of the games where the student government would pass out large signs during the basketball games. They passed out the Waldo sign to the Pep Band. Waldo first went to David Higgins, pictured in the photo holding Waldo. There was a common procedure where you traded your student ID to the person who handed you the sign so that you'd return the sign at the end of the game. David Higgins had not done that but still didn't feel good about taking Waldo with him. I didn't want to leave Waldo behind so I took him home with me and then continued to tote him with me to all the basketball games until I graduated and Waldo got passed along to Will who was one of my roommates at the time."</blockquote></p>

<p>Since then, Waldo has attended nearly every basketball game with a member of the trumpet section except for a brief period in 2018-19.  Will Blazer gave the cutout to his girlfriend, Lauren Kabel, who split responsibilities with Austin Kitts (Aerospace Engineering, ’18). The person Lauren had originally intended on giving the cutout to changed sections before the start of the 2018-19 season, and she did not know who a suitable replacement would be.  After one season without Waldo, I reached out to Lauren, who was happy to have him back in action with the trumpets.</p>

<p>Aside from some minor repair work (packaging tape has been applied around the borders to prevent further deterioration of the material, and foam board strips have been added for durability), Waldo has remained unchanged; a fixture of the pep band trumpet section for over a decade.  Hopefully, he can continue to be a part of our tradition for years to come.</p>
