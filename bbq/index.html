	<h2>100 Counties of 'Q</h2>
	<h3>One man's mission to eat North Carolina-style barbecue in every county of the great state of North Carolina</h3>
</center>
<br>

<body>
<p>In addition to football, I've long had two main loves: first, my home state of North Carolina, and second, my love of my home state's great tradition of pulled pork barbecue.  In January 2022, I decided to combine those loves and made it my goal to eat North Carolina-style barbecue in every single county in the state of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Now, before we get too far along, I'll acknowledge what some acolytes of our fine state's 'cue are probably already wringing their hands over: which style of barbecue -- Eastern or Western (Lexington) style?</p>

<p>Admittedly, I love them both.  Growing up in Charlotte, I was closer to Lexington style barbecue than Eastern style, but places to have both abounded.  In contrast to most of my friends in college, I prefered Lexington style over Eastern, but the preference was marginal -- let me again reiterate that I love them both.</p>

<p>Now, for those <i>not</i> in the know: North Carolina has two different styles of barbecue.  As mentioned above, the two camps are divided geographically, with some people tentatively agreeing that the boundary line roughly follows I-74.  Generally speaking, the line can be traced from south to north by starting at the southern end of the county line between Richmond County and Scotland County and  heading northward between Montgomery County and Moore County.  From there, however, the line becomes harder to define, splitting Randolph county clean in two, heading more or less due north til Asheboro, after which it wends it's way northwesterdly, bisecting High Point, Winston-Salem, and Mt. Airy on its way to the Virginia border.</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" you may be asking.  Good question.  There are a few main differences, but the main two boil down to the sauce it's served with, and the cut of meat used.  There are also differences in the cooking style and the preparation of the slaw, however these are more minor compared to the cut of meat and the sauce.</p>

Both use vinegar as their base for the sauce, often with red pepper (among other spices) added in, however Lexington-style takes it a bit further and adds a tomato base (often ketchup) to the sauce.  Done properly, the sauces should not be thick or sticky like Memphis or Kansas City style sauces, but instead watery in viscosity, roughly like the vinegar used in their base.</p>

<p>In terms of the cut of meat, the newer of the two styles, Lexington style, is more selective.  Lexington style uses only pork shoulders (also known as butts).  Eastern style, on the other hand, uses the entire hog, hence the common name of "whole-hog" barbecue.  Because of this, Eastern style is finely chopped and then mixed to help distribute the different cuts of meat, while Western style tends to be shredded.  This results in Lexington style being a naturally 'wetter' cut of barbecue, because drier bits like the skin are left out.</p>

<p>The last major difference in the meat itself is how it's cooked.  Eastern style hog roasters are more likely to use the traditional pit method of pig-picking--as in, a literal pit.  However, few restaurants actually use a true pit anymore because the fire they produce is difficult to control and the coals hard to rake.  Instead, most use a dug out pit with a built structure around it, usually employing cinderblocks and metal grates to help get the meat off of the ground.  The coals are still stoked and stirred in a dug out pit beneath the grates, but this gives room for air circulation and makes stirring them easier.  Usually, a pit cook will have either a cardboard or metal "lid" to place over the pit to help control circulation and flare ups.  Lexington style cooks, however, are more likely to use a structure more akin to a pizza oven, a sort of brick fireplace with two doors, one for the meat, and one for raking the coals.  This has the advantage of being much easier to control than the eastern style pits.</p>

<p>One minor difference regarding presentation is the slaw served with the 'cue.  Lexington style coleslaw tends to be "red slaw," which is standard coleslaw made with the tomato-vinegar sauce as its base.  Eastern style tends to be "white slaw," which uses mayonnaise as its base.</p>

<p>As for the wood of choice, that's anyone's bet.  Various hardwoods are used, though hickory and oak (especially white oak) are certainly the frontrunners.  I've had others swear that the secret to the perfect roast comes from using dogwood, though it's hard to come by large quantities of this; as far as I know, it's used mostly for finishing meats.  I've also heard of maple, birch, and peach being used, though they aren't as predominant.</p>

<p>A final note on wood is the cutting of the wood.  Though I've never actually met someone who proclaims to do so, old-timers swore that harvesting wood was best done under a waning moon, which resulted in the sap being at its lowest point; this helps get a longer-lasting and more consistent burn.  Modern thinking, however, says that it's more superstition than science.</p>

<p>Now, to get back to my mission!  Eating 'cue in every county in North Carolina is, naturally, easier said than done.  To start with, I decided to see just how many eateries I had been to before, and then went about finding a shack to eat at in every county.  I had the benefit of having done (most of) the <a href="http://www.ncbbqsociety.com/bbqtrail.html">NC Barbecue Society's Historic Barbecue Trail</a> with friends in December 2019, in addition to several stops on other trips.  Before even consciously attempting this goal, I had checked off 24 of the counties on the list while eating at at least 36 different joints -- some of them twice or more.  Without further ado, here's my list of BBQ joints visited by county, along with the date(s) I've visited them.</p>

<p>On this list, you'll see two certifications, <i>italicized</i> and colored <span style="color:blue">blue</span> to help distinguish them from the other stops.  The <a href="http://www.ncbbqsociety.com/bbqtrail.html">NCBS BBQ Trail</a>, the more prestigious of the two, is a list created by the North Carolina Barbecue Society to help identify important and emblematic restaurants across the state.  Pits were chosen because they were "representatives of the distinctive methods and barbecue cooking styles that have made North Carolina the Barbecue Capital of the World."  In addition to cooking their meat only on wood or coal, other requirements for inclusion are that the pit make their own sauce, operate for 12 or more years, and have a sit-down dining area.  The other certification is the <a href="http://www.truecue.org/true-cue-nc">True 'Cue NC</a> certification, which has largely similar requirements, but is less selective and more wholistic in its approach.  You'll notice that several pits cary both honors.</p>

<p>I've also made a map to visually keep track of the stops I've made.  You can see that <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ef2IEFws3E_O3KqeWm1-Y9zCNNW5wS02">here</a>.</p>

<h2>A bit about some of the restaurants</h2>

<p>While it would be both impossible and uninteresting to write about each and every restaurant I've been to, I would be remiss if I did not mention anything about them at all.</p>

<p>First up are the stops of the NCBS Historic BBQ Trail.  While I had done 17 of the original 22 stops with friends in three days (read about that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/ebn3o1/we_traveled_the_historic_nc_bbq_trial/">here</a>), the final 3 stops on the trip (Switzerland Cafe, Hubba Hubba Smokehouse, and Herb's Pit BBQ*) were all either closed for the season or deemed too far to reach based on certain unexpected time delays.  As such, when I had a few months between graduating college and starting full-time work in the summer of 2021, I spent about two weeks hiking and eating barbecue with my brother and finished up the list.</p>

<p>Before that, though, I want to talk a bit about this grand extraveganza of barbecue.  Me and four other friends were all big fans of barbecue and, having recently discovered the trail, wanted to immerse ourselves in it.  However, being college students, we had fairly limited free time.  Since all of us had <i>mostly</i> finished our exams early that December, we concocted a plan: visit the entire trail in three days.  This time cruch was partly my creation; remember how I said we were "mostly" done with exams?  Yeah, I was that caveat, and took an exam the day after finishing our tour.  I have no regrets.</p>

<p>We started early, leaving Raleigh around 8 AM.  We drove straight to Pitt County, where a hotspot of traditional barbecue pits still thrive.  To make up for the closure of Wilber's, we stopped at Parkers, a restaurant I had visited a few times before since a friend worked there as a server.  With our "heretic" gas-cooked 'cue as a primer, we moved on to the real stuff, hitting up Skylight Inn, Bum's, and B's in rapid succession.  From there, we worked southwest, to Grady's, to Stephenson's, before finally taking a bit of a break at Carthage's Pik n Pig.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the register workers were pretty universally confused when the five of us would walk in together, order a single pint of barbecue, and sit down.  Over time, we got better at explaining our mission, but the first few explanations were a bit rough.  After one such introduction, at Carthage's Pik n Pig, I was standing at their post-office styled checkout counter waiting for our food to arrive, I asked about purchasing a copy of "The Great NC BBQ Map" produced by EDIA which they had displayed in the store (note: EDIA is now defunct, but their map has been invaluable in organizing my cross-state mission, and would recommend finding a copy if you're interested in barbecue in this state).  After hearing about our trip and our plan, the hostess smiled and told me to take it for free.</p>

<p>We only had two stops left for the day after Pik n Pig: Hurseys, and Stameys.  By the time we got to Hurseys, it was nearly 6 o'clock, but we resisted the temptation to stop and eat a full meal there and powered on to Stameys, where we had our first true meal of the day since our early brunch at Parkers.  We each got a regular plate so we could taste the 'cue in its purest form, as well as sides.  Several of us were also coerced into ordering some of their fantastic milkshakes (they've somehow mastered the art of making a milkshake taste just like a peach cobbler).</p>

<p>After a brief night of rest at a friend's lakehouse off High Rock Lake, we were back on the road.  We started the day heading due north, to Fuzzy's, before working our way back southwest towards Winston-Salem.  At the now-closed Hill's BBQ, our group had the biggest treat of the whole trek.  Having arrived fairly early on a Saturday, the place wasn't too busy.  After hearing about or sojurn, the owner, Gene Hill, offered to take us back into the depths of the building, and showed us their smokers, the wood racks, and the grills.  He could not have been more excited to see young people interested in traditional barbecueing, and was very amicable throughout.  Forever the music enthusiast, I also bought a CD by local Southern Gospel musician Jerry Lambert.</p>

<p>Reinvigorated by our behind-the-scenes tour, we moved deeper into the heart of Winston-Salem, where we stopped at Real Q.  The building we visited (at 4885 Country Club Rd) was the original location of a diner called Little Richard's; opened in 1991, Little Richard's quickly became a local favorite.  Originally owned by a group of three owners who franchised the restaurant in multiple locations, confusion regarding the number of locations and their disparate menues fomented in 2018, driving the 'original' Little Richard's to rebrand as Real Q.</p>

<p>From there, we went to the barbecue mecca of the state: Lexington.  No city has more smokehouses or has its air so permeated like the aptly-named "BBQ Capital of the World."  After a quick stop at Smiley's, we went to Bar-B-Q Center, where we sat down for lunch and watched college basketball between bites.  Regretfully, we couldn't be fully "statriotic" because there wasn't a Tobacco Road game on at that time of day.  While I truthfully don't remember who was playing, in retrospect, the only game worth watching that morning was Oregon-Michigan, so I'll assume we watched the closing minutes of that.</p>

<p>From Lexington we worked our way further southwest, to Salisbury, where we had what was universally panned as our least-favorite 'cue (at Richards) and what I rated as my personal favorite (at Winks).  I haven't been back to Richards, so I can't confirm if it was just a bad day or not, but our panel of five did not enjoy our first stop in Salisbury.  Imagine my surprise, then, when Wink's came out with some absolutely killer tender meat and some sauce that was just the right amount of sweet and vinegary.  We rounded out the day with stops at Lincolnton's BBQ King and Red Bridge's BBQ in Shelby.</p>

<p>The final day, regretfully, did not go as planned.  As mentioned previously, Switzerland Cafe and Hubba Hubba Smokehouse were both closed for the season.  Hubba Hubba's closure was expected, however the Switzerland Cafe's closure was not; at least, according to the guy who planned the trip.  Instead, after taking a few pictures from inside the grounds of a similarly-winterized resort, we pivoted and headed northward, for Spruce Pune, where we had lunch in at the now-closed Hef's Restaurant, the only Italian restaurant I've ever been to that claimed not to serve pasta on Sundays -- but still served me a lasagna.</p>

<p>From there, we made the executive decision to skip out on Herb's, and instead did a day trip to Asheville's historic Omni Grove Park Inn, where we caught the closing day of the hotel's annual gingerbread house contest, as well as an awesome sunset.  From there, we high-tailed it back to Raleigh; I had my friends drop me off at the library, where I stayed up all night to study for a Thermodynamics exam I did just poorly enough on to pass the class.  Again, no regrets.</p>

<p>Since the initial trip in 2019, several of the stops have fallen victim to the times.  The Pik n Pig tragically burnt down in May 2021 but has plans to re-open.  Hill's BBQ closed after the original owner passed in December 2019, and Wink's BBQ closed during the COVID-19 pandemic the next July.  Wink's continues to live on in a sense under the tutelage of <a href="https://www.thesmokepitonline.com/">The Smoke Pit</a>, a new North Carolina-based barbecue company emphasizing traditional cooking techniques.  Their Salisbury location uses the former Wink's building.</p>

<p>* Wilber's BBQ was also closed at the time due to tax evasion, however I had visited prior to its temporary closure in March 2019.  As of this writing, I have not revisited the re-opened restaurant.  M&ampK BBQ in Granite Quarry was closed with no word as to why when we visited, but remains listed on both the NCBS and True 'Cue lists, which makes me think its closure may have been temporary.</p>

<p>After graduating from NC State in the Spring of 2021 and accepting a job which started that June, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my final month of freedom: finish the barbecue trail.  I set out crafting a series of hikes and camping spots around Western North Carolina with the main objective of hitting up those last three spots.</p>

<p>The first hike of the trip involved no barbecue -- that should have been a red flag from the start.  Due to a combination of my brother's slothful nature as well as NC DOT's decision to trim trees along what must have been every state highway we drove along, we arrived at the Smokies later than I had wanted.  I had chosen a bluegrass-related hike -- the Smokys' "Rocky Top," a semi-formal name applied to a rocky outcropping of the impressively-named Thunderhead Mountain which supposedly lent its name to the bluegrass song made famous by the University of Tennessee and the Osborne Brothers.  Unfortunately, unbeknownst to me, overnight camping was prohibited (even along the Appalachian Trail) without a pricey permit which I had failed to secure.  We decided to try and do the whole 12-ish mile hike I had planned in one day; this was foolish to begin with since we started just before 3:30 PM, and made even more foolhardy by the constant drizzle which accompanied us for the first hour or so of the hike.  A wrong turn which took me about a mile to notice cemented the futility of the hike, and we turned around about 5 miles from Rocky Top.  All I could do was look up the hill, chuckle, and sing to myself, <i>"Wish that I was on old Rocky Top..."</i>.  In retrospect, it was pretty fitting.</p>

<p>The Switzerland Cafe was the first target to fall.  Coming up from Waynesville, my brother and I stopped in Little Switzerland before hiking in the Doughton Recreation Area.  Our server was a friendly girl who had just recently moved south from somewhere up North who professed to know absolutely nothing about barbecue; given that she worked at one of what is arguably the twenty most important barbecue joints in the state, I did my best to briefly teach her a bit about barbecue in this state (given my grandiloquence above, you can tell how much self-restraint that took).  While in the area, we hiked to the historic Caudill Cabin via the Basin Creek Trail.  A slight bummer on the trip was discovering a tree had fallen on my brother's car while we were camping.  Thankfully, the damage was shockingly minor -- it had just dented the hood, scratched some paint, and knocked off the passenger side mirror.  Thankfully the kind folks (and their dogs) of the Gilbert General Store, near McGrady, helped us get the mirror taped back on.</p>

<p>The next stop was easy: Hubba Hubba Smokehouse, in Hendersonville, is right near the Green River Gamelands.  We drove in early that afternoon and feasted on barbecue and cornbread. During our meal, we were entertained by some chickens which wandered around the outdoor seating area.  I assume they belonged to the smokehouse, however, I'm really not sure.  After supping, we drove southwest, through Flat Rock and to the game lands.  Our first stop was the Green River Narrows, a spot famous among white water kayakers for its technical and dangerous rapids.  The power of the water was enormous.  Afterwards, I took my brother to Little Bradley Fallsl, an impressive waterfall (in spite of its name) that I had visited previously with my dad.</p>

<p>That left Herb's as the last stop on the list.  I planned to do a 6-mile hike to hit several waterfalls in Panthertown Valley, near Cashiers, and then head west to Murphy.  Thanks to the "social trail" nature of Panthertown and a deluge of rain, we got a bit lost, and the hike ended up taking longer than expected, but we did manage to get to Herb's (which was, in practice, not nearly as close as I had hoped it would feel like to Panthertown) about a half hour before closing time.  Due to the post-COVID job exodus, their restaurant's entire seating area was shuttered, acting as a sort of walk-up only eatery.  One poor teenage boy did everything, preparing sides, serving out barbecue, taking orders, and cleaning as necessary.</p>

<p>With that, my first mission was complete; I had finished the Barbecue Trail.</p>

<p>I generally try to plan similar trips around most of my stops.  For example, I visited Motley's BBQ on a trip with my girlfriend to Pond Mountain and the NC-TN-VA Tri-Point.  My 2wd Sante Fe barely made it up the gravel road to the trailhead, but it made it nonetheless.  Similarly, I visited Hillsborough BBQ Company after a quick and easy loop around the Historic Occoneechee Speedway Trail.</p>

<p>My most extreme solo trip was a 1,600-mile (round-trip) journey to Starkville, Mississippi for the NC State-Mississippi State football game in 2021.  After camping at Ellicott Rock Wilderness, I continued west, stopping at Brasstown Creek Gathering Place, one of the few non-NC stops on my list.  Being right at the state lines of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, the Gathering Place offered servings of each style of sauce. All of their options were delicious, but I was especially impressed with their SC-style mustard sauce, which I had never tried before.  It was mixed with brown sugar and was absolutely phenomenal.  Fortunately or unfortunately, I had loaded up on boiled peanuts at the Mountain Top Trading Post, where a nice lady originally from Alabama taught me how to eat them, much to her bemusement -- "They ain't got bo'lled peanuts down in Charlotte?" was a question she asked me at least twice.</p>

<p>Originally I had intended to stop on my second day of traveling in Brent, Alabama, at The Sawmeal Restaurant, a cute restaurant which claimed to have Eastern NC style barbecue -- I wanted to see how genuine it was.  However, I mistakenly had ordered a massive tray of food at Brasstown Creek; that, combined with my hearty consumption of peanuts, meant I had more than enough food as it was.  Instead, I polished off the leftovers for the remainder of my trip, in addition to all the food the kind Starkville family whose tailgate I crashed I could stomach.</p>

<p>A final point of explanation lies in just how many times I've been to a select few restaurants.  The most obvious outlier is Stameys BBQ in Greensboro.  During my time at NC State, I was in both the marching band and the pep band, and traveled to several of the ACC tournaments for both men's and women's basketball.  It just so happened that nearly every year I was in band, one (or both) of the two tournaments were in Greensboro, in the Greensboro Colliseum.  Conveniently, Stameys is right across the street; it's almost too perfect to be a coincidence.</p>
