<h1>Scorigami</h1>

<p>"Scorigami" is a way of tracking historic sports scores first conceptualized by sports historian Job Bois in his popular video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l5C8cGMueY">Every NFL Score Ever | Chart Party</a>.  The document is a way to visualize whether a game has ever ended with a specific score, organized by the winning team's score along the x axis and the losing team's score along the y axis.  I have adapted the concept to cover NC State's football record specifically, and the results are shown below.</p>

<p>For example, if NC State has ever had any game end 24-17, regardless of winning or losing, that game will be represented below.  Mouse over a score to see the most recent instance of the game result.  This implementation does not work on mobile; my apologies.</p>
