<center><h1>NC State Football Scorigami</h1></center>

<p>"Scorigami" is a way of tracking historic sports scores first conceptualized by sports historian Job Bois in his popular video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l5C8cGMueY">Every NFL Score Ever</a>.  The result is a way to visualize whether a game has ever ended with a specific score, organized by the winning team's score along the x axis and the losing team's score along the y axis.  I have adapted the concept to cover NC State's football record specifically, and the results are shown below.</p>

<p>For example, if NC State has ever had any game end 24-17, regardless of winning or losing, that game will be represented below in a green square.  Scores which are impossible to attain (either because the loser's score is higher, or because the scoring structure of football prohibits it) are colored black.  Scores which were formerly possible but are no longer (ties) are colored orange.</p>

<p>Hover your mouse over a score to see each instance of the game result.  This implementation does not currently work on mobile; my apologies.</p>
