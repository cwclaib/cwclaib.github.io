<p>Unfortunately, not many details of the game against South Carolina have been preserved.  Just the third game ever played by A&ampM outside of the state of North Carolina and her sixth-ever out-of-state opponent, the Red and White had not fared well against out-of-state teams recently.  Their two previous out-of-state games (1895 vs VMI and 1899 vs Clemson) had been lost by a combined score of 6-64, and their last three-straight out-of-state opponents had been losses.  Heading in to this game, the Fighting Gamecocks had really only started playing out-of-state matches in 1898, having lost to the Augusta Athletic Association in 1894 but then playing only in-state opponents for the next 4 years.  In 1898, they played the Robert Bingham School, of Asheville, North Carolina, winning 16-5, and Davidson, losing 0-6.  In 1899, the Garnet and Black played the Robert Bingham School twice, once in Columbia, where they won 11-5, and once in Asheville, where they lost 6-18.  The South Carolinians also played Davidson in 1899, losing 0-5.</p>

<p>In the 1900 season, South Carolina had played just three games so far, and only two complete games.  They opened their season with a 0-5 match against Georgia in Athens; the Columbians forfeitted the game after the referee refused to award them a game-tying touchdown.  Their second match of the season had been against Guilford, which they had won 10-0.  Their third match was a 0-51 slaughtering at the hands of Clemson watched by 5,000+ spectators at the South Carolina State Fair (<a href="https://digital.tcl.sc.edu/digital/collection/garnetblack/id/4412"><i>Garnet and Black</i>, 1901</a>, p. 160; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/184140113/?terms=clemson%2B%22south%2Bcarolina%22%2Bfootball%2Bfair"><i>The Greenville Daily News</i>, November 2nd, 1900</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>The A&ampM team left Raleigh on the Tuesday, November 9th, for South Carolina.  They reached Greensboro around dinner-time and ate; their rush to get back on the road prompted <i>The Greensboro Evening Telegram</i> to write the following humorour observation: "The boys were told that they had only two minutes in which to eat supper here, and the way they made Gresham's edibles fly was a sight to behold" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75852857/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 10th, 1900</a>, p. 8; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/64810277/?terms=%22south%2Bcarolina%22%2B%22A.%2Band%2BM.%22%2Bfootball"><i>The Greensboro Evening Telegram</i>, November 10th, 1900</a>, p. 1).  In addition to the regular members of the football team, four substitutes joined the team on the trip.</p>

<p>The longest description of the game available to me came in <i>The Greenville Daily News</i>.  The report carried no description of the game, but did carry some details.  Reportedly, the crowd was "big," and the game was exciting. According to the paper, "the teams were so evenly matched that they kept the on-lookers guessing; but in the second half Carolina made a score of 12.  Which Carolina?  South Carolina of course" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/184144359/?terms=south%2Bcarolina%2Bfootball"><i>The Greenville Daily News</i>, November 11th, 1900</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>A&ampM coach Joel Whitaker was furious over the loss, not because of how his team performed, but because of the work of the referee.  In Whitaker's own words, the referee, a Mr. Jennings, of Wofford College, "robbed the A. and M. College of a safety, ruled out the end plays which were used in every game this season by the Carlisle Indian team, misinterpreted the rules to benefit the South Carolina team, and this once when their [South Carolina's] coach told Jennings he was wrong" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/57884369/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2Bfootball"><i>The North Carolinian</i>, November 15th, 1900</a>, p. 7).  Whitaker made no such claims throughout the rest of A&ampM's paltry 1900 season, so I can only assume that his complaints were justified in this game.  A second report published in Raleigh wrote that in addition to the stolen safety, that A&ampM was "penalized... without cause" and that South Carolina was also arbitrarily given the ball "when the A. and M. was near their goal."  Finally, the referee reportedly "refused to notice forward passes" made by the South Garnet and Black team (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/64553975/?terms=%22A.%2Band%2BM.%22"><i>The Raleigh Times</i>, November 12th, 1900</a>, p. 2).</p>
