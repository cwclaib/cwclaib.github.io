<p>The Farmers got the chance to avenge their loss three weeks prior in a marquee Thanksgiving-day game against South Carolina.  With the Tar Heels off playing Georgetown to a tie in Washington, DC, and Wake Forest and Trinity holding a debate in direct opposition to the violence of football, the A&ampM-South Carolina game was the most attractive game in North Carolina for anyone who wanted to spend their Thanksgiving watching quality college football.  No announcement was made in the papers of when this game was scheduled, so it was likely not scheduled due to the consternation that resulted from the result of their first meeting on November 10th, but it was advertised as a rematch game.</p>

<p>The two teams were quite different in style of players and play.  The A&ampM team "as a rule, is composed of big, strong fellows, who are well up on the game."  Papers publicized the fact that the team had gotten better as the season had gone on, noting their furtunate lack of injuries throughout the year, with only Calvert, Welsh, Gardner, and Newton possibly sitting out of the game due to their injuries.  South Carolina's team, on the other hand, was known to be strong.  They were reported to have "some fast sprinters and hard tacklers," and had distinguished themselves to be seen by some as "the champions of the South."  Though such a title was certainly sensationalized and not true, the team was a strong one (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75853126/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 29th, 1900</a>, p. 5; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58149607/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, November 29th, 1900</a>, p. 5).</p>

<p>South Carolina's team arrived in Raleigh on the morning of the 29th with 17 players.  Local papers reported that "the farmers say they will redeem themselves today, though some of the players are in bad shape."  Despite the reported injuries to Newton and the others, all four of them played (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/64554421/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The Raleigh Times</i>, November 29th, 1900</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>The game was seen by a crowd described as large and "fair" despite the fact that "Throughout the whole game the rain poured."  The rain soaked through the field to make the ground a muddy mixture of dirt and water, and the strong northwesterly wind made the kicking difficult.</p>

<p>The game started off well for A&ampM.  Lougee booted the ball for the opening kickoff, but his kick was low and got blocked by Freeman, of the Fighting Gamecocks.  Though the Garnet and Black had blocked the ball, McKinnon landed on the ball, giving the Red and White the chance to run the opening drive.  The Farmers ran the ball all the way down the field, to South Carolina's 10 yard line, but there lost the ball.  Fortunately, South Carolina soon thereafter lined up offsides, and the ball was given back to the Farmers.  From there, A&ampM again advanced the ball closer and closer until Wright made a 3-yard run to score the first points of the day for the Raleigh boys.  Lougee missed the goal kick, and the opening score stood 5-0 in favor of the Farmers.  This took up about half of the first half.</p>

<p>Yancey kicked the ball for South Carolina.  Gardner caught the kick for A&ampM and made a "nice run" of 25 yards, but the Farmer drive was soon stopped and the ball was turned over on downs.  South Carolina then broke out a 40-yard run off of a double pass play, and gained another 15 more yards on a few other plays before losing the ball on downs.  Thompson then attempted to pass the ball, but the pass was  high and intercepted by Deal, who ran the pick in for a touchdown.  Bell kicked the goal for the Garnet and Black and the score stood 5-6 in favor of the South Carolinians.</p>

<p>Louge then kicked the ball off for the Red and White, kicking to Deal, who returned the ball 10 yards.  The "sand lappers" drove the ball all the way down the field, "mainly on end plays."  Oliver scored the touchdown for the Fighting Gamecocks, but Bell missed the goal.  The first half ended not long later with the score standing 5-11 in favor of South Carolina.</p>

<p>The second half went much worse for the Red and White.  "In the second half the ball is in A. and M.'s territory all the time; South Carolina easily making her gains."  Despite the fact that South Carolina "repeatedly" lost the ball on offsides plays and for holding, A&ampM was unable to convert on the turnovers.  Eight minutes into the second half, Yancey scored the third touchdown for the Columbians, and Bell got the goal.</p>

<p>"The rest of the half is mainly kicking," wrote the <i>News and Observer</i>.  A&ampM ended the game in possession of the ball on South Carolina's 30 yard line, with the score ending 5-17 in favor of South Carolina.  Turner and Gardner played "great ball" for the Red and White, as well as Welsh, while McKinnon's work at center was commendable.  South Carolina's stars were Oliver, Bell, and Yancey (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75853142/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 30th, 1900</a>, p. 3).</p>

<p>Ironically mirroring the feelings of the A&ampM team after their game in South Carolina, the Fighting Gamecocks felt cheated by the referees.  A local paper read "On a rocky field and in a cold rain Carolina defeated the Agricultural and Mechanical College of North Carolina by a score of 17 to 5.  It was a good, hard fought game [sic] Carolina played a better game than usual and had both officials to play against as well" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/89021508/?terms=football%2Brecord%2B%22agricultural%2Band%2Bmechanical%22"><i>The Watchman and Southron</i>, December 5th, 1900</a>, p. 2).</p>
