<p>Davidson's football team picked up where they left off in 1899 and continued to build on their program's momentum.  One of just two major teams in the state of North Carolina who did not join the North Carolina Athletic Association, Davidson's football team was in just their third year of playing.  After going 0-2 in 1898, the program went 1-3-1 in 1899, tying A&ampM.  However, those records were both furnished without the benefit of a head coach over many teams who had been playing football for several years longer than the Presbyterians.  In 1900, Davidson had for the first time ever a coach in the form of John A. Brewin, a former Boston College football player.  While at Davidson, he led the Red and Black to a 12-12-1 record.</p>

<p>Davidson opened their season without the benefit of Brewin.  Their first game, against Guilford at home, they won 16-0 over Guilford despite their lack of a coach.  In their second game of the season, Davidson lost to Clemson 0-64.  At that point, Brewin stepped in to become Davidson's head coach.  A&ampM was the first team played under Mr. Brewin's tutelage, the team having not played since their October 10th loss to Clemson (<a href="https://lib.digitalnc.org/record/29119?ln=en#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=188&r=0&xywh=2347%2C382%2C2034%2C1236"><i>Quips and Cranks</i>, 1901</a>, p. 143).</p>

<p>Reportedly the only game of the season played in Charlotte, the "cranks" of Charlotte were excited for the game.  And since Davidson students got every Monday off, "Practically all the students of Davidson College" were expected to come to Charlotte to watch the game.  The game was expected to be "very close" and a "large crowd" was "assured."  Heading in to the game, A&ampM's team was reported to be heavier than Davidson's team.  Despite that, papers reported that Davidson was "reasonably hopeful of success."   Papers also prediced the success of the Davidson team despite the absence of Ahabeg "David" Yonan, a student from Persia who had formerly trained with the football team.  Yonan had played left tackle for Davidson when the Presbyterians faced the Farmers in 1899, and was a very successful track and field athlete, holding several of the school's field day records; tragically, Yonan drowned before the start of the 1900 football season while attempting to save a friend who was drowning in the Catawba River (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/62286450/?terms=davidson%2Blatta"><i>Charlotte News</i>, November 10th, 1900</a>, p. 1; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/73818376/?terms=south%2Bcarolina%2Bfootball"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 11th, 1900</a>, p. 5; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/62286567/?terms=davidson%2Bfootball"><i>Charlotte News</i>, November 12th, 1900</a>, p. 1; <a href="https://lib.digitalnc.org/record/29119?ln=en#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=92&r=0&xywh=2191%2C1100%2C2156%2C1310"><i>Quips and Cranks</i>, 1901</a>, pp. 67, 152; <a href="https://lib.digitalnc.org/record/29082?ln=en#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=120&r=0&xywh=2303%2C1167%2C2588%2C1572"><i>Quips and Cranks</i>, 1900</a>, p. 107).</p>

<p>The game began at 3:30 PM with former A&ampM coach and Charlotte resident George Stephens refereeing the game, and prominent Charlotte businessman L. A. Dodsworth acted as the umpire.  A&ampM started the game with the ball, kicking off to Davidson.  Through "steady gains" the ball was advanced towards the A&ampM goal until, after 1 minute and 10 seconds of play, Wyamn, of Davidson, carried the ball the final 10 yards and across the goal line for a touchdown.  The ball was placed between the goal posts, and though it was not specifically mentioned, this almost guarantees that Davidson made their goal kick. The score stood 0-6 in favor of the Presbyterians.</p>

<p>A&ampM's second kick off went just 20 yards, to the Davidson 30 yard line.  "By the line bucking of A. S. Caldwell and the pretty end runs of Wyman and Huie, the pigskin was carried steadily down the field to within 10 yards of A. &amp M.'s goal."  Fortunately for the Farmers, Davidson fumbled the ball; the fumble was recovered by A&ampM.  Unfortunately for the Farmers, they were unable to make the 5 yards required for a new set of downs, and the ball went back over to Davidson.  At that point, Wyman of Davidson elected to kick a "try-at-goal," an early version of what is now considered a field goal.  Wyman's kick went between the posts (which were then shaped like an "H") but under the crossbar.  The result of the miss was that A&ampM kicked the ball off from their own 25 yard line.  A somewhat minor distinction is that this means the kick was tried from outside of the 25-yard line, since if a "drop kick at goal" was attempted on a first down inside the 25-yard line, the kick off would be performed from the 10 yard line instead of the 25.  A&ampM's kick went over the side line and was given to Davidson.  Davidson again advanced the ball the length of the field and again fumbled the ball "near the A. and M. goal."  After the Red and Black again fumbled the ball, the Red and White for a second time failed to make a first down, returning the ball to Davidson.  By the work of Wyman, Huie, and Caldwell, the second Davidson touchdown was scored, with Huie being the man who carried the ball across the goal line.  Wyman missed the goal kick, making the score 0-11.  There were 10 minutes left to play in the first of the two 25 minute halves.</p>

<p>A&ampM again kicked the ball off, kicking the ball to Davidson's 35 yard line.  "Davidson, with a series of runs and plunges through the centre by her plucky and quick backs, carried the ball down the field again to the A. and M.'s 15-yard line."  The Presbyterians fumbled the ball close to the goal line for a third time, and the Farmers again recovered the fumble.  The Red and White then made their first recorded first down of the game, but failed to do it a second time.  Dalton kicked the ball away on the third down, and the ball went out of bounds midfield, giving Davidson the ball.  Davidson's team slowly worked their way back up field, until they reached the 15 yard line.  Wyman attempted a "try-at-goal kick" for a second time; this time, the ball sailed left of the goal posts.  A&ampM took the ball to the 25 yard line and kicked off again.  The kick went out of bounds around midfield.  The first half ended with the ball about 15 yards from the A&ampM goal line.</p>

<p>The second half began Davidson kicking off to A&ampM, but again the Red and White failed to gain the requisite 5 yards for a new set of downs.  After getting the ball, Davidson again fumbled, this time "in the effort to make a triple pass."  As the paper wrote, "once in the hands of the Raleigh boys it became an inspiration for a new effort to save the day by a steady ground-gaining, line-bucking by the A. and M. backs."   Though the paper wrote it was the first time that Davidson failed to hold the Farmers, based on their game report it was actually the second, though the fact that A&ampM had gained only two first downs around the start of the second half should be sign enough of how the game went.  The Farmers brought the ball to within eight yards of Davidson's goal.  The ball got as close as the 5 yard line according to some reports, but "in ten downs the A. and M. boys were rushed back until on the 10-yard line the A. and M. was obliged to kick."  From there, "A bad fumble gave the ball to Davidson again."  Steady drives by the Presbyerians brought the ball to Davidson's 40 yard line, 60 yards from A&ampM's goal line.  There, Huie executed the "cleverest feature of the game" by running a 60-yard touchdown across the goal line.  Wyman made the kick, and with that the Presbyerians were up 17-0.  Despite the fact that Davidson failed to score a second time, the Red and Black still reportedly controlled the remainder of the game (<a href="https://infoweb-newsbank-com.proxy141.nclive.org/apps/news/document-view?p=AMNEWS&t=pubname%3A11260DC9BB798E30%21Charlotte%2BObserver/year%3A1900%211900/mody%3A1113%21November%2B13&action=browse&format=image&docref=image/v2%3A11260DC9BB798E30%40EANX-112CC1AE3406D900%402415337-112CC1AF39E5FDB0%405-112CC1B1E7C80D30&origin=image/v2%3A11260DC9BB798E30%40EANX-112CC1AE3406D900%402415337-112CC1AE45BFE4B0%400"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 13th, 1900</a>, p. 6; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58149484/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, November 13th, 1900</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>Charlotteans reportedly showed "a good deal of enthusiasm" about the game, despite the lopsided score.  It was reported that "nearly all the Davidson College students, instructors, and alumni" of Charlotte were at the game, in addition to "several hundred other people" and "a good many" supporters of A&ampM.  That year, the number of students and teachers at Davidson totaled just under 200; conservatively estimating the other numbers gives an estimated attendance of 500, though no paper ever gave a formal estimate.  Stars of the game for A&ampM were reportedly Turner, Dalton, "her big full back," and "the plucky quarter back, Worth."  As for Davidson, the whole team showed "fine team work" and helped showcase the individual performances of A. S. Caldwell, Huie, and Wyman (<a href="https://lib.digitalnc.org/record/31082?ln=en#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=27&r=0&xywh=42%2C1014%2C2580%2C1567"><i>Davidson College Catalogue</i>, 1900-1901</a>, p. 18; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76084205/?terms=davidson%2Bfootball"><i>Asheville Citizen</i>, November 14th, 1900</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>The A&ampM football players arrived back from their "disastrous campaign on the gridiron" probably late in the night of the 12th, having left Charlotte for Raleigh at 6:20 on the night of the game.  According to reports, when they arrived back in Raleigh "Many of them were are lame and bruised."  The <i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i> reported the Davidson game to be "clean from start to finish," with each team trying to "out-vie the other in gentlemanly behavior."  If that report is to believed, then it is possible that the A&ampM players were badly injured from the game against South Carolina, which would have in turn limited their effectiveness against Davidson (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75852887/?terms=davidson%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 15th, 1900</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>On November 22nd, Davidson went on to defeat South Carolina 5-0 in Charlotte, and a week after that the Presbyerians journeyed to Augusta, Georgia, where they faced Georgia Tech who they defeated 38-6.  Davidson ended their season with a 4-1 record.  In addition to their main team, Davidson's Medical College team won two games, defeating Oak Ridge 6-0 and Wofford College 11-17.  Finally, Davidson's "scrub" team defeated the "Deaf Mutes of Morganton," the same team who Chapel Hill opened their 1900 season against, 7-11 (<a href="https://lib.digitalnc.org/record/29119?ln=en#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=188&r=0&xywh=2347%2C382%2C2034%2C1236"><i>Quips and Cranks</i>, 1901</a>, pp. 142-143).</p></p>
