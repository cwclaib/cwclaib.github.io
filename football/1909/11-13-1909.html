<p>Following their narrow win against Washington &amp Lee, the Farmers returned home for their fourth and final home game of the season against the U.S.S. <i>Franklin</i>.  The game was highly anticipated for several reasons.  First was the weight of the the <i>Franklin</i>ites: their line weighed an average of 200 pounds, and the entire team clocked in at 180, which was the as much as the Farmers weighed, though some reports later added that the Sailors weighed slightly more (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/80401333/?terms=football%20kentucky&match=1"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 26th, 1909</a>, p. 3).  Second was the fact that the Sailors were one of the best naval teams in the country, having won the title among ships in the Norfolk Naval Yard in 1908 and an undefeated recording coming into the game (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/80401461/?terms=%22washington%20and%20lee%22&match=1"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 9th, 1909</a>, p. 3).  In fact, since 1908, the team had been defeated only once, in a game to Norfolk's Brambleton Athletic Association which the navy boys lost 5-6 on a fluke play (<a href="https://archive.org/details/officialfootball1909nati/page/94/mode/2up">Walter Camp</a>, p. 95).</p>

<p>The U.S.S. <i>Franklin</i> organized her team in September.  The team was coached by Christian P. Segard, leader of the Portsmouth Naval Y.M.C.A., and managed by J. D. McNair, the ship's Chaplain.  Captained by Yeoman 2nd Class, A. B. Hamilton, the team reported quick progress due to a number of men returning from the team of the previous season, including Hunt, Fuller, Hamilton, Goddard, Garrity, and Barkhurst; another player named Feidt was also a reported returner but did no appear in the A&ampM game.  Early on it was "expected that the team this year will emulate if not surpass the excellent record made last year by the Franklin team" (<i>The Man-O'Warsman</i>, Vol. 1 No. 11 (September 1909), pp. 605, 607).</p>

<br>

<p>Unfortunately, a full schedule of the <i>Franklin</i>'s season is not known, though the team itself admitted early on that the A. &amp M. game would "undoubtedly be the hardest and most interesting game to be played by the team of the Franklin" (<i>The Man-O'Warsman</i>, Vol. 1 No. 12 (October 1909), p. 655).  Their known games include a 17-0 win over the U.S.S. Louisiana, a 35-0 win over the US Navy Hospital Corps, and a close 8-6 win over the U.S.S. Minnesota on October 30th.  The Sailors also had a game scheduled against the Norfolk Light Artillery Blues on November 19th, scheduled to coincide with the visit of President Taft and Vice-President Sherman to Norfolk; they lost the game 0-6.  Finally, the Tars forfeited a game at an unknown date (probably late in November) to the U.S.S. <i>North Carolina</i> for unknown reasons.  Their team closed their season on November 23rd with a banquet in Norfolk.  They formally closed their season on November 23rd, but later went on to ring in the New Year with an exhibition game against an "All-Collegian" team from Norfolk on January 1st; they lost the game 0-10.</p>

<p>The game also symbolized the first time a naval team had played in Raleigh, or possibly even the state of North Carolina.  The visit to Raleigh was highly anticipated because the Sailor football players and their contingent of roughly 3-700 seamen (the number presented by the <i>Franklin</i> herself was 500), along with a band and bugle squad, planned to visit Raleigh's monument to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worth_Bagley">Ensign Worth Bagley</a>*, with a joing military parade comprising A&ampM's cadets and sailors from several of the ships of the Norfolk Naval Yard guiding their way to the monument (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58246279/?terms=%22U.S.%20Ship%20Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>The (Raleigh) Evening Times</i>, November 12th, 1909</a>, p. 7; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/80401501/?terms=%22U.S.%20Ship%20Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 13th, 1909</a>, pp. 1, 3).  The parade culminated in the battalions arriving at the statue, which was draped "with a large national flag" and the bands playing "Taps," "Nearer My God To Thee," and "The Star Spangled Banner" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616580264/?terms=%22Franklin%22"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 14th, 1909</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>Though the football team arrived a day early, the other sailors arrived in Raleigh at 12:30 PM and immediately started the parrade, following a long train journey down from Norfolk.  Though it was heavily covered in North Carolina papers, I found the description of the parade printed in <i>The Man-O'Warsman</i>, the journal of the U.S.S. <i>Franklin</i>, to be the best:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the way down [from Norfolk] the word had been passed around that Raleigh was going to give the bluejackets a big welcome, but the scene at the Union depot and out on Martin street when the special arrived made the Navy sit up and take notice.</p>
<p>Drawn up in a battalion formation were the cadets of A. and M., headed by their band. Sidewalks and windows were a sea of faces, and everywhere was a cheer and a cordial greeting. Paymaster Van Patten was met by Henry Bagley, a brother of Ensign Bagley and Mrs. Josephus Daniels, a sister of the dead officer. With Paymaster Van Patten on the special was Mrs. Francis L. Chadwick, the wife of Lieutenant Commander Chadwick, execuutive officer of the FRANKLIN, who was a classmate at Annapolis of Ensign Bagley. Mrs. Chadwick, before her marriage, was Miss Julia Dewey, and lived in Raleigh, so it was most appropriate that the men of the FRANKLIN should have requested her to place their wreath upon the statue.</p>
<p>Not ong after the special had arrived the parade was formed. It was headed by a large touring car, in which were Mr. and Mrs. Bagley, Mrs. Daniels, Mrs. Chadwick and Paymaster Van Patten. Then came the FRANKLIN'S leading mascot, a blue-clad William Goat, led by a sailor. Following this was the receiving ship band and bugle corps and the five hundred blue jackets under the command of Chief Petty Officer Hugh Moore. The A. and M. band and cadet battalion came after the sailors.</p>
<p>It was the first time in history that Uncle Sam's tars had marched through the capitol [sic] city of the Old North State, and all along the way up Martin and Fayetteville streets to Capitol Square they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>The square was packed with people, but a space was cleared around the Bagley monument by forming the sailors and cadets into a hollow square, with the FRANKLIN'S band drawn up beside the statue.</p>
<p>The exercises were most simple. There was no formal ceremony and no oratory. Not a word was spoken except the commands of the company officers. When the last platoon of the cadets had taken its position the navy band played "Nearer My God to Thee." At the close of the hymn the command to uncover was given and five hundred white caps were held across five hundred blue-clad breasts. Mrs. Chadwick and Paymaster Van Patten stepped to a place beside the statue, Buglemaster Lupton stepped forward and blew "Taps." As the last plaintive note died away Mrs. Chadwick took the wreath that has been held by Paymaster Van Batten and tenderly palced it upon the flag draped base of the monument. The wreath was in the design of a sheild crossed by a broken sword and stood several feet in height. Then the men were called to attention and the band played "The Star Spangled Banner" (<i>The Man-O'Warsman</i>, Vol. 2 No. 2 (December 1909), p. 3).</p></blockquote>


<p>Following the much-heralded parade, much of the crowd met the teams at A&ampM Athletic Field, where they had been since the parade started, preparing for the game.  Much was made of the preparation of the rooters for both teams, who had prepared special yells and songs for the event and the bands' songs which went with them.  One entire set of bleachers was filled with the Norfolk sailors, who brought along with them their mascot goat, who wore a piece of fabric which read: "He's a Butter But We are Better / Oh, you Goat - U. S. S. <i>Franklin</i>."  According to retrospective reports, the game against <i>Franklin</i> represented "the first organized body of rooters to appear on an A. &amp M. athletic field in opposition to the Red and White since the time when A. &amp M. of North Carolina and the University of North Carolina used to meet" -- in other words, since 1905 (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/650697253/?terms=football%20schedule%20farmers&match=7"><i>News and Observer</i>, September 12th, 1911</a>, p. 3).</p>

<!-- See the page on football songs for links to the songs and cheers made by each team.</p> -->

<p>Because of the lively rooting and the close game, the game was said to be "notable in the history of athletics in Raleigh" by several papers.  The <i>News and Observer</i> gives a good indication on the rowdiness of the crowd:</p>

<blockquote>If ever Raleigh has seen a more enthusiastic assemblage it has disappeared in the mists of time.  Just imagine hundreds of men on either side "rooting" with all their ability, plus their lungs and two hands and it will be nearly impossible to judge what was going on. Add to this the general gathering, the over-crowding of the side lines, the fruitless efforts of policemen, military and naval officers, to keep back the rush, and the general hubbub, and it will be possible to get a faint idea of what was done, at the football game, while cutting out the air in segments were the songs, the yells and the hurrahs of the <i>Franklin</i> men and the A. and M. supporters, who made the afternoon one loud, long shout, with music and whistling accompaniment thrown in as an overplus.</blockquote>

<p>Coming into the game, the Farmers had one clear goal in mind: improve their signal work -- a critical task given A&ampM's oft-injured team this season (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/80401461/?terms=%22washington%20and%20lee%22&match=1"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 9th, 1909</a>, p. 3).  Though it had been hoped that several of A&ampM's injured players (Hartsell, Von Glahn, and Seifert, in particular) would be in good enough shape to play the game, such was not the case, as none of those players took the field.  Part of this was likely caution on the part of Coach Greene, who likely wanted to keep his team as fresh as possible in preparation for the coming Thanksgiving Day game.</p>

<p>* A Raleigh native, Bagley was the first and only death during the Spanish-American War; his death was widely seen as a symbol of the reconciliation of the South after the Civil War.  The monument had been dedicated just two years prior to the game (<a href="https://docsouth.unc.edu/commland/monument/100/">DocSouth</a>).</p>

<p>The game kicked off at 3:30 PM wth <i>Franklin</i> defending the west goal.  Robertson of A&ampM kicked off, sending the ball 45 yards, to <i>Franklin</i>'s 10 yard line, from where McGurn returned it 20 yards.  On the next play, Barkhurst made a run for 5 yards, followed by runs for 4 and 2 yards by Fuller and McGurn.  Barkhurst then made two consecutive 5-yard gains to put the Sailors at A&ampM's 51-yard line.  After a run by Duncan for no gain, the Farmers earned the ball on a failed forward pass from <i>Franklin</i>.</p>

<p>Runs of 4 and 5 yards by Keasler and Robertson put the ball back to <i>Franklin</i>'s 40-yard line, where Stephens punted, sending the ball back to the Red, White, and Blue's 10-yard line.  Garrity returned the kick most of the way, bringing it back to around the 30.  After a gain of 4 by McGurn and 1 by Goddard, the Sailors again lost the ball on a failed forward pass, giving the Farmers the ball.</p>

<p>A short run by Keasler for 2 yards started A&ampM's next drive, but their next play was an impressive 10-yard pass from Stephens to Stafford.  However, after a 5-yard run by Long and a 1-yard gain by Keasler, the Aggies were short for the first down line, forcing Stephens to punt.  He sent the ball to <i>Franklin</i>'s 20-yard line, where the Sailors started their next drive off with a loss of 2 yards by Dunn; on the next play, McGurn punted the ball away, sending it to midfield.</p>

<p>Another short Red and White possession for A&ampM was ended after 5 yards of total gain by Robertson and Long, who got 2 and 3 yards, respectively.  Stephens punted the ball to <i>Franklin</i>'s 25-yard line; after a 1-yard gain by McGurn, he decided to punt the ball back, sending the ball right back to center field.  A 1 yard gain by Stephens and a 4 yard gain by Robertson forced another A&ampM kick, Stephens this time punting the ball to the 15-yard line.</p>

<p>After a 5-yard gain by McGurn, he punted the ball to A&ampM's 50-yard line; there, the Red and White lost the ball on a fumble.  The Navy men immediately capitalized on this mistake, with Goddard opening their drive with a 15-yard run around A&ampM's left end.  The Farmers recovered ably, though, as on the next play Barkhurst was thrown for a loss of 3 yards.  A 5-yard gain by Garrity made back up the distance, but yet another unsuccessful forward pass gave the Farmers back the ball around their own 35-yard line.</p>

<p>With the Mechanics back in possession of the ball, Stephens punted, sending the ball 35 yards away.  After a 2-yard run by McGurn and a loss of yardage by Goddard, one of the most exciting plays of the game took place: on a very long attempted drop kick goal from beyond midfield by McGurn, <i>Franklin</i>'s kick missed, with the ball landing around the 5-yard line.  Stephens picked up the ball and began running, as <i>The Man-O'Warsman</i> so delicately put it, "like a scared rabbit."  Stephens made it 75 yards through <i>Franklin</i>'s "whole team" before finally being caught around <i>Franklin</i>'s 25-to-30-yard line.</p>

<p>The A&ampM quarterback would have made it across the goal line had it not been for the Hurculean efforts of the kicker, McGurn, and Goddard, "<i>Franklin</i>'s ten-second man."   Reports differ slightly as to how he was caught: while all agree that those two men were chasing Stephens, <i>News and Observer</i> reports that though neither could reach him individually, one "reached out and shoved forward his colleague of the <i>Franklin</i> team, who with the added impetus" was able to save the touchdown, while <i>The Man-O'Warsman</i> stated that Goddard "with an almost superhuman effort... dived headfirst at the heels" of Stephens to stop him (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v11n3#?c=&m=&s=&cv=56&xywh=2131%2C1222%2C2531%2C1482"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. 11 No. 3 (November 1909)</a>, pp. 163-164); a 5-yard run by Glenn brought the ball even closer.  However, tragedy struck on the next play, and the Men-o'warsmen got the ball on an unsuccessful forward pass.</p>

<p>The Sailors immediately punted the ball away, sending it to one of the 45, where Stephens returned it 5 yards.  After a 5-yard gain by Robertson, <i>Franklin</i> tried to call their fourth timeout of the half; since teams were only allotted 3 per half at this time, the Farmers were given 2 yards for the infraction.  Stephens kicked the ball to the Sailors' 15-yard line.</p>

<p>As the 20-minute first half was coming to an end, Garrity and McGurn made 2 and 3 yards, respectively.  The first half ended with the ball in the hands of the Red, White, and Blue at roughly the 25-yard line.</p>

<p>Noticing <i>Franklin</i>'s ease of gaining in the first half, especially around the right side of A&ampM's line, Coach Greene shuffled around his men during the intermission.  Greene moved Keasler from his starting position of right halfback to left tackle, replacing Hurtt; Kealser was replaced by Glenn.  Additionally, Lassiter replaced long in the fullback position, and Wilson replaced Haynes on the right end of the line (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v11n3#?c=&m=&s=&cv=56&xywh=2131%2C1222%2C2531%2C1482"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. 11 No. 3 (November 1909)</a>, pp. 163-164; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58246296/?terms=%22U.S.S.%20Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>The (Raleigh) Evening Times</i>, November 15th, 1909</a>, p. 8).</p>

<p>The second half started very well for A&ampM.  <i>Franklin</i> kicked off to A&ampM's 5-yard line, where Lassiter caught the kick and returned the ball 20 yards.  A 20-yard run by Glenn brought the ball to the 45-yard line, and a 5-yard pickup by Robertson made it to the 50.  On the next play, however, Lassiter was unable to gain, forcing Stephens to punt; fortunately, <i>Franklin</i> fumbled and Bray recovered the ball for A&ampM.</p>

<p>After a run for no gain by Glenn and a 2-yard loss by Stephens, an unspecified penalty (probably either holding or being offsides) was assessed to the Farmers, costing them 15 yards and their excellent field position (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v11n3#?c=&m=&s=&cv=56&xywh=2131%2C1222%2C2531%2C1482"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. 11 No. 3 (November 1909)</a>, pp. 163-164).  Stafford attempted a drop kick goal but missed, giving the Norfolk boys a touchback.  Taking advantage of the new change in rules which allowed a team who got a touchback to choose whether to punt or to run a play from scrimmage, the blue jackets opted for the latter.  The gamble appeared to pay dividents quickly after a pair of 10-yard runs by Barkhurst and Fuller combined with a 5-yard run by Hunt carried the ball to the USS <i>Franklin</i> 50-yard line.</p>

<p>Things continued to look bad for the Farmers.  After the Aggies were called for being offsides and a run for no gain by Barkhurst, Fuller gained 4 yards and McGurn 1 yard; though this should have taken all three of their allotted downs, the Red, White, and Blue punted, McGurn sending the kick to A&ampM's 25-yard line.  After two runs for 4 yards by Lassiter, Stephens attempted to punt the ball away, however the Navy men blocked the kick, giving them the ball on A&ampM's 10-yard line.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Red and White, their defense stepped up in a big way: Barkhurst gained only 1 yard, and Fuller was tackled for a loss by Mott.  On their third and final down, the <i>Franklin</i>ites attempted another drop kick goal, but the kick missed; Stephens recovered the ball and carried it to A&ampM's 8-yard line, where, on the next play, he punted the ball 35-yards down the field.</p>

<p>The next drive by the <i>Franklin</i> stalled after a pair of runs for 3-4 total yards of gain by Barkhurst and another failed drop kick goal.  After a run by Stephens was stopped for a loss of 2 yards, the quarterback punted the ball to midfield, finally relieving the Farmers' goal of danger.  Runs for 3 and 5 yards, respectively, by McGurn and Barkhurst brought the ball a bit closer, but the Sailors' kick to A&ampM's 20 moved it even further.</p>

<p>Here, fortune finally began to smile on the Farmers; Stephens punted the ball away; <i>Franklin</i> fumbled the ball, giving the Farmers possession at midfield.  After gains of 5 and 3 yards by Lassiter and Glenn, Stephens punted, sending the ball to the Navy's 15-yard line.  However, Wilson tackled Garrity, who had signaled for a fair catch, moving the ball up to the Red, White, and Blue's 30-yard line.</p>

<p>The Farmers soon got their yards back: on the next play, <i>Franklin</i> was penalized 15 yards for holding.  The blue jackets punted the ball 45 yards, to the A&ampM 50, where a Red and White player caught the kick and carried it back to midfield.  On the next run, Lassiter made 12 yards on an off-tackle play, and on the next Robertson gained 15, taking the ball to around the USS <i>Franklin</i>'s 25-yard line.  On the next play, however, Glenn was penalized 15 yards for hurdling, robbing his team of "a fine chance to score."  After a run for no gain by Stephens, the quarterback punted to the <i>Franklin</i>ites 8-yard line.</p>

<p>Here, the tide of the game really turned.  Close to their own end line, the Norfolk men attempted two consecutive runs, with Garrity gaining only 1 yard and Barkhurst gaining only 2.  Facing their third and final down with 7 yards to gain just yards from their goal line, McGurn dropped back to kick.  Unfortunately for the Sailors, the snap from Hamilton was too high, and though he reeled in the snap he was unable to salvage the play.  Reports differ on how exactly the play failed (he either tried to advance the ball or had his kick blocked by Bray), giving A&ampM possession somewhere between 1 yard and 6 inches of the <i>Franklin</i>'s goal line.  After one undescribed play by the Farmers for little-to-no gain, Glenn was pushed across the goal line for a touchdown on a play run from tackle back formation.   "Owing to some technicality the referee forced Stevens [sic] to kick before he was ready," resulting in a miss (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58246296/?terms=%22U.S.S.%20Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>The (Raleigh) Evening Times</i>, November 15th, 1909</a>, p. 8).  The Farmers took a 5-0 lead with just 3-to-4 minutes of play remaining in the second half.</p>

<p>Robertson kicked off to <i>Franklin</i>'s 5-yard line, where McGurn returned the kick 30 yards.  A 4-yard gain by Barkhurst started a promising drive for the Sailors, but on the next play Fuller was tackled for a loss.  Another bad snap by Hamilton gave the Farmers the ball back on the <i>Franklin</i>'s 30-yard line.  There, Stephens attempted a side kick play, but the ball went over the goal line, resulting in a touchback for the USS <i>Franklin</i>.  The Sailors attempted to put the ball into play, but time was called before any play could be made.</p>

<p>Despite being down several key starters (Von Glahn, Hartsell, and Seifert), the Aggies showed up admirably against the team deemed the strongest they had faced "since the ark run aground on Ararat" and a defense likened to a steam engine (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58246296/?terms=%22U.S.S.%20Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>The (Raleigh) Evening Times</i>, November 15th, 1909</a>, p. 8).  Stars for A&ampM were said to be Stephens ("the most spectacular player"), Dunn, Bray, and Mott, though <i>Red and White</i> noted that "Every man on the team played his position well."  For the USS <i>Franklin</i>, the stars were said to be Goddard and Barkhurst, as well as McGurn and Fuller, who were noted for their ground-gaining abilities, though it was noted that on the whole the <i>Franklin</i>'s interference was better than that of A&ampM.  Despite that, A&ampM's backs were slightly quicker (likely owing primarily to their approximately 15-pound weight difference) (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/80401521/?terms=Franklin%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 14th, 1909</a>, p. 11; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616580298/?terms=%22ship%20Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 14th, 1909</a>, p. 9; <i>The Man-O'Warsman</i>, Vol. 2 No. 2 (December 1909), p. 38).</p>

<p>After the win, A&ampM cadets reportedly took to the town to celebrate, marching around Raleigh "with bands and torchlights."  According to reports, even though they lost, nearly 300 <i>Franklin</i> boys joined in on the merriment (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/146477342/?terms=%22Franklin%22%20football&match=1"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 14th, 1909</a>, p. 7).  For their win over the USS <i>Franklin</i>, the Sailors pledged their support behind A&ampM for their upcoming Thanksgiving Day tilt in Norfolk.  The Sailors, along with their band--and goat--would be in Norfolk in full force backing the Red and White.  The entire naval battalion who came to Raleigh left at 7:30 PM after a full day of excitement.  Pre-game reports from the 1911 season indicate the sailors kept their word: "At the last two Thanksgiving games in Norfolk, no more loyal supporters of A. &amp M. could be found than the Franklin sailors, and their support has proved a valuable A. &amp M. asset each year" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/650697253/?terms=football%20schedule%20farmers&match=7"><i>News and Observer</i>, September 12th, 1911</a>, p. 3).</p>

<p>Despite the low score, the Farmers were jubilant about their win; the game showed they could beat a strong team without several critical starters.  It is likely most A&ampM fans knew that this was their last game of the season before their final hurrah in Norfolk against their recent rival, VPI.  The Sailors were understandably upset, writing "That the FRANKLIN team lost is due to nothing but hard luck.  At no time did A. and M. outplay them, and in the first half the men-o'warsmen had all the better of the argument, allowing A. and M. to make furst down only two or three times and keeping the ball in Carolina territory during the greater part of that time.  Had the navy captain stuck to straight football in this half on two occaisions when the A. and M. goal was in danger instead of resorting to the forward pass it is very probable that a touchdown would have resulted, for the offensive work of the men-o'warsmen could not be resisted by the collegians while both attempts to make long gains on the pass were failures and gave the ball to A. and M." (<i>The Man-O'Warsman</i>, Vol. 2 No. 2 (December 1909), p. 38).</p>
