<p>Despite the large loss that accompanied A&ampM's first game of the season, spirits were high coming into the second game.  One article wrote "the chances are good to win....  They were badly defeated last week by the University, but that is no reflection on their prowess.  And then, too, they learned in that game more football lore than could be boned out in a week's practice" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58197676/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The Press-Visitor</i>, October 16th, 1895</a>, p. 1).  Additionally, A&ampM's team was reported to be "improving in its work," with hopes for a good season expected (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76248528/?terms=richmond"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 16th, 1895</a>, p. 5).  Though the previously-quoted <i>Press-Visitor</i> wrote that A&ampM had played both Richmond and Wake Forest (A&ampM's competitor for the following day), writing that they defeated Richmond and "played a very hard game" against Wake Forest, I have found no further record of those games; C. D. Harris also wrote that this Friday game was not only the first time A&ampM had played Richmond, but also the first time the Farmers had played any team from Virginia (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v12n4">C. D. Harris</a>, p. 176).  Despite the <i>Press-Visitor</i> writer's optimism for the A&ampM team, he predicted that A&ampM would lose the game.  Another positive factor for the A&ampM team was that last year's highly-successful halfback, Vick, was back for the team, though it is unclear why Vick was not in the UNC game, or how he lost his role as captian.  Additionally, Alexander, who had injured his nose earlier in the year, was expected to play despite the injury.</p>

<p>The game, which was set to start at 4 PM, was to cost just 25 cents (about $7.50 in 2019) to watch.  It was also mentioned that "both teams are in good condition and are about evenly matched.  The game will be worth seeing" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58197743/?terms=richmond"><i>The Press-Visitor</i>, October 18th, 1895</a>, p. 4).  Despite the glowing pre-game review of the teams, the crowd was described as "not so large as usual," with a notable absence from "Raleigh's beauties"; despite the small crowd, the crowd "made up in enthusiasm what it lacked in number."</p>

<p>The train that Richmond arrived on came in 3 hours late, causing the starting time of the game to be pushed back to 5 PM.  The Richmond, which averaged 160 lbs, went directly from the train station to Raleigh Athletic Park; the team was described pre-game as "fatigued and a little stiff in their joints" due to their trip, with one author writing that the Olive and Orange "showed the effect of the travel in their playing."  Because of the lateness of Richmond's team, the game was played with havles of only 20 minutes; reportedly, darkness overtook the field just as time was called (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76248581/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 19th, 1895</a>, p. 5; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58197748/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The Press-Visitor</i>, October 19th, 1895</a>, p. 1).  Richmond's team had only played one game this season so far, losing 4-16 against the Hapton Athletic Club.  Though <i>The Press-Visitor</i> gave the most pre-game coverage to A&ampM's team, the <i>News and Observer</i> wrote a lengthy writeup on the game.</p>

<p>Once Richmond arrived on the field, the game was started.  Richmond won the coin toss and got the ball.  Eubanks kicked off, sending the ball to the 20 yard line.  Following the catch, Alexander made a 30-yard run that "carried the ball to the centre of the field."  Alexander's run was stopped by Wilborn, and Richmond soon thereafter got the ball back on downs.  Not much of material happened after that, with the teams repeatedly failing to gain the 5 yards required for a new set of downs, resulting in a turnover on downs.  Eventually, McNeill, for Richmond, punted the ball to A&ampM's 10-yard line.  Fortunately, the Red and White recovered the ball and successfully advanced the ball to the center of the field before the first half ended.</p>

<p>To start the second half, Alexander of A&ampM kicked the ball 30 yards to the Richmond 20, where it was received by Wills, who ran the ball forward 15 yards, his run being ended by Thomas.  For about eight minutes, the ball stayed in the center of the field, but eventually, Richmond brought the ball down to A&ampM's 20 by "successive rushes," but soon thereafter lost the ball on downs again.  A&ampM advanced the ball via end-runs by Wootten, Vick, and Hunter back to the center of the field, where Alexander punted the ball.  McNeill again caught the punt, but fumbled the ball when he was tackled.  A&ampM recovered the ball, and Alexander proceeded to punt the ball again, the ball this time going high into the air and reaching Richmond's 15-yard line.  A&ampM again received the ball after the Spiders failed to convert.  Hunter made a 3 yard run, followed by a 2-yard run by Graham around the right end, and a run for no gain by Alexander.  Vick then ran straight into the line for a 2-yard gain.  After that, Clark fumbled the ball.  The ball landed on Richmond's 7-yard line, where it was secured and run in for a touchdown by Thomas.  The <i>News and Observer</i> says that Alexander "kicked the goal just as time was up," but <i>The Press-Visitor</i> says the score was made with 3 minutes left to play.  Either way, the touchdown and goal was celebrated with "tumultuous shouting and hollering."</p>

<p>That paragraph summarized all that was notable during the first half.  Between the halves, Kendall was taken out and replaced by Vick; Kendall was unable to play the duration of the game "on account of recent sickness."  Additionally, Richmond pulled Slike in place of White.</p>

<p>Two fairly notable events took place in the second half, but unfortunately we have no formal reference as to when they took place.  The first event, which took place "at the beginning of the second half," was the substitution of Bizzell for Wright.  Wright was disqualified from the game for "alleged slugging."  The second notable event was a 30-yard run by Eubanks around A&ampM's ends.  His run, the longest of the game, was brought to an end by Vicks.</p>

<p>The referee for the game was Perrin Busbee, former coach of the A&ampM team.  At that time, Busbee was practcing law locally in Raleigh.  The umpire was John Gore, captain of Wake Forest's football team.  Althout a linesman was not recorded for the game, it seems likely to me that if there was one it was either Bart Gatling, who acted as linesman for the game the following day against Wake Forest, or Mr. Ryland, manager of Richomd team, who worked as linesman in the Richmond-UNC game the following day.</p>

<p>The Richmond team was described as "clever" and "not very sore over their defeat."  According to <i>The Press-Visitor</i>, Richmond blamed their defeat in part on their "extraordinarily rough railroad ride."  Railroad or not, Richmond's team failed to win a single match the remainder of the season.  The following day, the Spiders lost 34-0 to UNC (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/70263133/?terms=richmond%2Bfootball"><i>The Tar Heel</i>, October 26th, 1895</a>, p. 1).  That season, Richmond would go on to tie Hampden-Sydney 0-0, lose to the Virginia Military Institute 0-44, and lose to Virginia 0-62.</p>
