<p>W. A. Reynolds, former Princeton football star and coach of UNC since 1897, had returned again to coach the Tar Heels.  Under Reynolds' leadership, the Tar Heels had executed an impressive 9-0 season in 1898, and had a career record 16-3 at UNC at the start of 1899.  Reportedly, "About two thirds of last year's [1898] team are back in training, and among the new applicants are many promising candidates."  A&ampM's team was reportedly "in good condition and expects to put up a good, stiff game" the day before they met the Tar Heels for the third year in a row (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76574074/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, September 29th, 1899</a>, p. 3; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76574390/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 7th, 1899</a>, p. 6).

<p>Neither team had played a game yet this season, so there were high expectations on both sides.  The expectations were likely higher, however, for UNC's team, who returned 7 of their 11 starters from their phenomenal undefeated 1898 team (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&q=Smith+Barrier%2C+On+Carolina%E2%80%99s+Gridiron%3A+1888-1936+">Barrier</a>, p. 26).</p>

<p>The game was called at 4 PM, with Carolina guarding the East goal. Weather was reportedly not the best, with some rain falling during the game, but "a big crowd witnessed the contest" nonetheless.  The game was played in two 20 minute halves.</p>

Person kicked off 45 yards for A&ampM, Graves reeling in the kick and running 25 yards down the field.  Koehler then carried the ball twice, first for a loss of 1 yard and then for a 25 yard gain.  After a few short carries by Coxe, Koehler unleashes a second long run, this run going the remainder of the distance down the field for 40 yards and a touchdown.  Graves missed the goal, and the score stood at 0-5, Tar Heels, after 3-1/2 minutes of play.</p>

<p>Person's second kick was signficantly shorter than his first, going just 25 yards.  Fortunately for the Farmers, Bennett fumbled the ball, causing the ball to roll out of bounds; there, Whitley fell on the ball for A&ampM, giving the Red and White their first possession of the game, starting at their 30  yard line.  Unfortunately, all the Farmers could muster was just under 7 total yards from 6 plays, and after runs by Whitley, Person, and Bunn, Whitley's second carry failed to make the line of gain, and the ball was returned to the White and Blue.  Fortunately, the 'Varsity failed to make the line to gain themselves, with Graves and Coxe combining for under 4-1/2 yards on 3 carries--just shy of the 5 yards needed to make a first down then.  On this drive, A&ampM had (and lost) "its only good chance of scoring."  After a pair of runs by Person for no total gain, Carolina committed an offsides penalty, giving the Farmers 10 yards.  From there, carries by Whitley, Person, and Bunn advanced the ball but after about 7 yards of gain the ball is returned to the Tar Heels.  Koehler was again star of the drive for the White and Blue, ripping off a 65-yard run after two plays for about 14 yards of gain by Coxe.  From there, Graves did most of the legwork to get the ball across the goal line.  This time, Graves made the kick, and the score was now 0-11 in favor of the White and Blue after another 7-1/2 minutes.</p>

<p>The next drive was short: though Person delivered a long 40-yard kick, Shull carried the return 20 yards, and Coxe subsequently performed an excellent 65-yard touchdown run.  After just 45 seconds of play, the Red and White had lost another 6 points due to Graves again making the kick.  With around 10 minutes left in the first half, the Farmers are down 0-17.</p>

<p>Person kicked the ball 45 yards again; Graves returned the ball 15 yards for the Varsity.  Coxe starts the drive with a 10 yard run, and after a subsequent handoff to Koehler, there was a pleasent change in pace for the Farmers: the star back who had been the source of such controversy fumbled the ball, giving the ball over to A&ampM.  Unfortunately for the Farmers, the turnover was nullified after just 3-1/2 yards of gain by Whitley on an offsides penalty.  UNC managed to get off two more plays before time expired, but neither amounted to much, and the first half ended with UNC up 17-0.</p>

<p>During the half, UNC changed up their players slightly, resting left guard W. Phifer and putting Rankin in his place, and putting McRae in to relieve right halfback Coxe.  Graves opened the half with a 40 yard kick; McKinnon received the kick for A&ampM and ran the ball 15 yards.  After a 1 yard gain by Bunn, UNC was again offsides, giving the Farmers another free 10 yards.  Person advanced the ball another 4 yards, but A&ampM subsequently fumbled the ball.  Person then made a "good kick" which was caught by Tar Heel quarterback, Martin, who advanced the ball 15 yards.  Immediately thereafter, a fresh McRae tore off a run of 25 yards, and after a few short gains by Koehler and Graves, Koehler made a 25 yard run of his own.  McRae and Graves made a few more runs for 7 yards, and then McRae made an 8 yard run to seal the deal.  After Graves missed the goal, the score was 0-22 in favor of the White and Blue.</p>

<p>Person again kicked the ball off for the Red and White, kicking a 35-yard boot that was returned 15 yards by Rankin.  After a few good runs by McRae and a short gain by Koehler, Graves ran for 15 yards.  Then, Bennett gained 5 yards for the White and Blue, but McRae subsequently lost 4.  Shull ran the ball 6 more yards, nearly crossing the goal line, but Graves failed to gain the required distance to make a new set of downs, giving A&ampM the ball.  Fortunately for the Tar Heels, Whitley immediately fumbled the ball, and I. Phifer recovered it.  After the fumble recovery, UNC's quarterback Martin was replaced by Lawson.  UNC's run up the field then featured a series of steady gains by McRae, Koehler, and Graves, with Graves carrying the ball the final 6 yards needed and successfully kicking the goal.  The Varsity was now up 28-0.</p>

<p>After UNC's fifth touchdown, McRae was relieved by Bellamy.  Person kicked off again for A&ampM, delivering another 40 yard kick.  Bellamy fielded the kick and ran the ball forward 10 yards.  UNC immediately lost the ball, though, due to a third offsides penalty.  From there, perhaps the lowest point of the game is reached: "After going from one side to the other three or four sides on off sides, it ends in Carolina's hands."  That brings the total number of offsides penalties in this game to seven or eight total infractions.  Determined to look the part of a major football team, UNC then whipped into shape.  After a pair of short runs by Bellamy and Graves, Koehler made "another beautiful long run for 75 yards," being downed a little over 10 yards from the goal line.  Koehler's run was the fourth longest in team history at the time (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&q=Smith+Barrier%2C+On+Carolina%E2%80%99s+Gridiron%3A+1888-1936+">Barrier</a>, p. 12).  After a short gain by Graves, "Bennett makes 8 yards with two or three men hanging on him."  That set up an easy run for Bellamy to earn the final touchdown of the game.  A successful kick by Graves made the score 0-34.</p>

<p>Not much happened in the remainder of the half.  Person kicked the ball for 20 yards, and after a few plays for no gain, Graves dropped back to punt; time was called before he could get his kick off, with the ball ending on A&ampM's 45-yard line (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/70265732/"><i>The Tar Heel</i>, October 11th, 1898</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>Though the Farmers lost the game, many of the papers had somewhat positive things to say about the team.  "For the visitors," wrote one article, "Paschal, Person, and Whitley played great ball."  Another paper wrote "The A. &amp M. has a good team, being especially strong in the line, but they lacked great odds of being a match for the lusty champions who pushed the pigskin for the old Tar Heel University."  The <i>Tar Heel</i> even wrote that "The visitors put up an excellent game and many say that it is the best state team that our team has met for many years."  The Red and White had still not scored upon the Varsity team of UNC, but came closer than ever before.  It should also be noted that this UNC was again one of the best teams in the South, going 7-3-1 on the year, with their only losses coming to some of the best teams of early college football--Navy, Princeton, and Sewanee, whose famous 1899 team went 11-0 was undefeated (and nearly un-scored upon) in games against giants such as Georgia, and Alabama A&ampM (present-day Auburn) (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58163676/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, October 8th, 1899</a>, p. 1; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76085184/?terms=north%2Bcarolina%2B%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>The Durham Sun</i>, October 8th, 1898</a>, p. 4).</p>
