Make individual pages for canceled games 1904 and prior

Go back and try to find heights and weights – at least add tabs for height and weight to previous years – pre-1898

Also go back and make hella long game descriptions for pre 1898 games shorter (or make "brief summary" page)

Go back and try and talk more about managers/etc when possible

Fix excessive use of neutral site games later	

Acknowledge that fields used to be 120 yards (had center at 60 yard line) - fix (1904 and before) - sure it's not 110?
