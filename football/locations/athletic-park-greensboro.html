	<h2>Athletic Park - Greensboro, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>Greensboro's <b>Athletic Park</b> was used periodically by Guilford in the early 1900s before the formal construction of their own, similarly-named athletic field.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 2-0 at this field, once as a neutral site and once as a road team.  Both games were nonconference games.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>


<p>First, a note: it is unclear and perhaps impossible to know if the canceled games against Guilford were meant to be played on their home grounds, an informal open area of campus known first as Athletic Park or Field but later as Hobbs Field, or in Greensboro proper, due to a lack of details about the proposed games.  The first Oak Ridge game is known with certainty: it was played at "the park of Greensboro Athletic Association"; the canceled game in 1894 was less specific in terms of location, however, given that this park was the only one listed in the 1899 city directory, it seems almost certain that this was the intended location [1] [2].  Similarly, though no reports specified where the 1895 Guilford game took place, Guilford's periodical, <i>The Collegian</i>, noted that the game took place in Greensboro rather than stating it took place on the college grounds, which at that time were a considerable distance away [3].</p>

<p>Next, a discussion on locating this park: reports on its location are decidedly vague.  The following 4 paragraphs, detailing the history of the North Carolina Steel &amp; Iron Company, are not required reading, but are related to my attempts to help nail down the park's location; as such, I have left them in.  This tangent was initiated because in June of 1893, the Greensboro Athletic Association formed with the intention of enclosing  grounds for playing baseball, football, and tennis.  Their location of choice was the grounds of the Steel &amp; Iron Company [4].</p>

<p><center> * * * * * * * * * * </p></center>

<p>At first glance, the location seems like an odd one: why would the baseball team want to use lands located a mile outside of town on the grounds of a heavily built-up manufacturing plant?  Well, the history of the company itself is no less odd.  The North Carolina Steel and Iron Company first chartered in February 1887 and organized in November 1889 with plans of becoming the first major ironworks in the state; towards that end, they began purchasing land at an aggressive rate in and around Greensboro, eventually totaling at least 2,200 acres [5] [6] [9].  Though a site to the southwest of Greensboro was supposedly purchased for the construction of the furnace in March 1890, for unclear reasons, the land was not immediately developed [7].  Instead, the company began developing a 600-acre tract 2 miles north of Greensboro, laying out at least 82 miles roads, 1,200 lots, and constructing three parks, with aspirations of linking their operations with the Richmond &amp; Danville RR, Cape Fear &amp; Yadkin Valley RR, and other comparatively minor railroads within the state [8] [9].</p>

<p>After this, things ground to a halt; in September, it was learned that not only had the construction on the furnaces not started, but that a contract had not been secured.  The company was also reorganized.  Rumors also began circulating that NC Steel &amp; Iron would sell out to a Virginia company [10] [11].  To help assuage fears, the owners began a press campaign, reorganizing and reiterating publicly and repeatedly their intentions of putting up a furnace and investing in the local economy -- so much so, in fact, that one local paper wrote in its local news section the following February that "For the hundredth time North Carolina Steel and Iron Company prospects [were] declared rosy"; later reports insinuate (in the guise of a letter from an interested Pennsylvania furnace owner) that some politicking was slowing down the process: "if it were not for the &mdash;&mdash;, who dominate your legislation I would despair of again getting back our business" [12] [13] [14].</p>

<p>By April 1891, work had still not progressed on the construction of furnaces; in fact, work was so behind that the committee inspected furnaces in neighboring iron-producing states to help secure the services of a furnace builder [15].  This seemed to progress things, and by late May it was announced (yet again) that a furnace was being built, this time to be located "immediately upon the south bank of North Buffalo [Creek] and one-fourth mile beyond the corporate limits of the city, and one block northwest of South Elm street" [15].  Work progressed rapidly, and by early November, the cornerstone was ready to be laid [16] [17].</p>

<p>By September, however, it was reported that the furnace was unused.  When asked why, a manager reported that the company did not have the $125,000 (over $4 million today) necessary to operate it.  As it turns out, one of the main companies sponsoring the Steel and Iron works, the North Carolina Improvement Company, was heavily indebted to several interests and went into receivership [18] [19].  In July 1894, the company was disbanded and re-incorporated as the Greensboro Iron and Steel Company after being purchased by an out-of-state syndicate, and the following June the plant sold 1,600 acres of its land (not, notably, including the furnace) to the Cone Company for the creation of textile mills for $37,500, almost all of which went towards paying off the Steel and Iron Company's debts [20] [21] [22].  By July, Cone had started work on both Revolution and Proximity Manufacturing Companies on the former land [23].</p>

<p><center> * * * * * * * * * * </p></center>

<p>To summarize the above, it is likely that the grounds used were among the vast sprawl of land purchased by the NC Steel and Iron Company while attempting to come into operation.  Where exactly the chosen land was, however, is a different story.  A birds-eye planning sketch of Greensboro from 1891 shows the northern suburbs purchased by the ironworks in greater detail than any of the fire maps, and includes three parks: a "Hotel Park" <!--36.0914272475532, -79.7864598066237-->bounded by Magnolia and Chestnut (now Church) on the east and west and Third (remains to the east, but now Northwood here) and Fourth Streets (no longer exists) to the north and south; a "Cool Spring Park" <!-- 36.086610381419064, -79.78079228638543 -->bounded by Percy (remains to the south, but now Yanceyville here) and Peach (no longer exists) and Second (now Wendover Ave) and Bessemer, and a "Fairview Park" <!-- 36.09584748562641, -79.77629808051623 -->bounded by Maple and Vine and Sixth (no longer exists, but probably is Bangle to the east) and Seventh (probably Textile) -- these spots seem like logical candidates [8] [24].  Though the land of Hotel Park was donated by the ironworks to <a href="https://www.ncpedia.org/kings-daughters-and-sons">The King's Daughters and Sons</a>, a New York-based company which operated the first hospital in Greensboro from 1891-1893, they chose a location <!--36.079668856436236, -79.7941655546965-->along Green Avenue (now Fisher/Battleground Avenue) [25].  There were intentions of turning Cool Spring Park into a hotel, however I have found nothing to suggest construction actually started [9].  I found no evidence of specific plans to develop Fairview Park.</p>

<p>Following the organization of the Greensboro Athletic Association in June of 1893, construction on the park began, though details are scarce. In early August, the first known match, a baseball game between the Guilford Battleground team and an Alamance Club took place on August 11th.  Though no post-game summary has been located, a seemingly-related report published not long thereafter stated that "Greensboro has the nicest baseball park in the state" [31] [32].</p>

<!-- https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ILUM1XHQL72bxAefIeiam7Vb6G2OEaf/view?usp=sharing -->
<p>And early on, the park's billing lived up to such heights.  Despite Greensboro lacking a professional minor league baseball team until 1902 (when the Greensboro Farmers, of the abortive North Carolina League, whose arrival precipitated in the construction of Cone Park, arrived; the league collapsed before the close of the season), the park hosted a variety of prestigious events, including a performance by the US Marine Corps Band in 1895, and a neutral-site game between the Universities of North Carolina and Virginia to determine the Champion of the South -- UNC lost 7-1 [33] [34] [35].  Three years later, the grounds hosted the spring training of the Boston Beaneaters [36].</p>

<p>Besides those big events, sporadic circuses, and minor ball games, the park was largely either unused or its usage went unreported.  Athletic Park remained in use sporadically through 1901, though its use as a professional venue was supplanted by Cone Athletic Field starting in 1902.  The park saw a revival in advertized usage in starting in the mid-1910s, seeing use by a variety of ameteur teams and fraternal organizations, as well as the practice grounds for the Greensboro Patriots [39].  The last report of the park's usage was on June 4th, 1932, with action as the practice field for the American Legion's junior team [37].</p>

<p>Though a "Base-Ball Park" is referenced in several city directories, the location of said park is decidedly vague.  The first references to the park in the 1899 and 1900 city directories state only "Proximity," a suburb to the north of Greensboro (later called Coneville, after its aforementioned purchase by Moses H. Cone; it was reported to be 1/4 mile north of city limits<!-- https://archive.org/details/greensboroguil190102unse/page/52/mode/2up?q=proximity -->) with no indication of a street address [3].  By 1905-1906, the address was more specifically noted as "Summit av nr Proximity" [26].  This makes the theory that our baseball park is one of the aforementioned parks unlikely, as Summit Avenue is several miles east of each of them, unless "Base Ball Park" is a different field that the Athletic Park.</p>

<p>Locating the field is also made difficult by the creation of Cone Athletic Park in virtually the same area: Cone Park was constructed near the 700 block of Summit Avenue in 1902, but moved several hundred yards north to the 900 block in 1906 -- This will be detailed further on the Cone Athletic Park page.  Confusingly, the first time an address was given for the Athletic Park, it was also in the same vacinity, and strangely, Cone Athletic Park did not appear in a directory until 1915 [27].  Instead, the only details on its location are that it was located to the north of the city.</p>

<p>The only tentative object linking the current location of this park to this location is a report from 1910, briefly mentioning a US Marine Band concert in the park from 1895.  Notably, 1895 reports only say it took place in "the Greensboro Base Ball Park," while the 1910 report refers to the "old baseball park" [34] [29].  While that in-and-of itself is not exactly a smoking gun, several articles from the period refer specifically to an "old ball park on Church street" [30].  Finally, an 1897 writeup on the Greensboro Athletic Association noted that the city team would use "the ball-ground north of the city" for games, "and the vacant Fisher lot on North Elm will probably be used for practice games" [28].</p>
<!-- Additionally, the park was not enclosed of the land which became Fisher Park (bounded by Wendover, Church, Fisher/Battleground, and Green Hill Cemetery), as an 1897 paper  -->

<p>Unfortunately, I have been unable to determine know exactly when the field was destroyed, or even its exact, precise location.  It was not captured in any maps of the city I have found.</p>
