<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Work on the stadium, with assistance from the Work Progress Administration (WPA), started in November 1935.  The initial cost of construction was about $240,000 (just over $5 million in 2023), of which $180,000 was supplied by the WPA, $30,000 was supplied by New Hanover County, and $27,000 was supplied by the Wilmington's American Legion Post No. 10.  Work was often delayed so that the field, while still under construction, could be used to host events: nearly 60 baseball games, which drew an estimated 40,000 spectators; at least 15 football games (of which the 1938 match against The Citadel was the first), which drew an estimated 15,000 fans; a horse show, which drew a crowd of 4,000; several iterations of The Coastal Fairs, which pulled in about 8,000; and a series of wrestling matches, which attracted about 7,000.  With all the delays, work was not complete on the stadium until 1940.  The original venue had 2 baseball diamonds, 2 softball diamonds, 4 horse stables, a field which could seat 10,000 (4,000 of which were permanent), and a 12,000 sq. ft. "utility building" for indoor events and exhibits at the fair [1].</p>

<p>The venue continued to host events of a similar ilk after its formal opening, as well as Negro League baseball teams. Later reports of its capacity, however, were generally well below the figures above -- typically, between 6- and 8,000 seats, a portion of which were removable.  A report of its opening claimed that 6,100 of the venue's seats were permanent concrete stands [3].  A football game between ex-HBCU All-Stars and black soldiers from Fort Bragg was the first exhibition of a game under pro-style rules in Wilmington in 1942, and was heavily advertized [2].  Despite the variety of entertainment, the stadium repeatedly struggled to draw crowds, with local Tobacco League baseball meetings averaging about 1,000 fans per game, with a season high of just 3,000 in 1947 [4] [5].</p>

<p>Sadly, my newspaper coverage of the field runs out in 1947, so I can provide no more details on its growth or development.  A historic plaque in Wilmington notes that the field had been "renovated periodically" by the city several times over its near-century of service [8].  The sports complex continues to house a baseball diamond (Buck Hardee Field) and a football field (Legion Stadium), in addition to a swimming pool and lighted tennis courts, and hosts a number of high school competitions annually at each venue.  The capacity is now reported to be about 6,000, however, it is unclear which venue that refers to [6] [7].</p>
