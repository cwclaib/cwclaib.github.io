<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>As Florida's athletics grew into prominence in the 1920s, their existing athletic fields lagged behind, leading the team to play several of its higher-profile games in Jacksonville and Tampa.  Hoping to bring those games back to their home campus as much as possible, and as the 1920s drew to a close, they began seeking land to build a new venue.</p>

<p>Eventually, an undeveloped shallow ravine to the north of campus was selected.  Construction began in April 1930 with the hopes of opening prior to the start of the coming football season, however, construction was delayed when the excavated site revealed an underground stream which had to be diverted.  Because of the delays, the Gators did not play a game at Florida Field until November 8th, playing their previous six games largely on the road or at neutral sites.</p>

<p>Florida Field, which opened as a horseshoe-shaped stadium, had an initial capacity of 21,769.  Starting in 1949, the stadium was heavily renovated, adding permanent lighting, completing the bowl, and adding a second deck, bringing the venue's total seating to 40,116.  In 1965, the stadium was again renovated, increasing the size of the press box and expanding the east bleachers so the stadium could hold 62,800.  The stadium was expanded again in 1982 and 1991 with various additions, bringing the capacity to 72,000 and 83,000 respectively.  Finally, in 2003 luxury and club level seats were added, allowing the field to host 88,548 [1].</p>
