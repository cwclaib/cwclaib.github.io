	<h2>JMA Wireless Dome Stadium - Syracuse, NY</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Archbold Stadium</b> was used by Syracuse from 1907-1978; it replaced the <a href="https://digitalcollections.syr.edu/Documents/Detail/the-old-oval-and-other-syracuse-university-buildings/20782">Old Oval</a>, a small on-campus field, and was replaced by <b>The Carrier Dome</b> after a year-long stint spent bouncing around between venues, but mostly using Giants Stadium.  The Carrier Dome was renamed <b>The JMA Wireless Dome</b> prior to the start of the 2022 football season.</p>

<p>At the close of the 2022 football season, NC State had a record of 6-2 at this field, going 3-2 since the two teams have been conference foes.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Archbold Stadium opened in 1907, and was named in honor of John D. Archbold, vice president of Standard Oil, a philanthropic benefactor who donated $600,000 (just under $21 million in 2023) towards its construction in 1905.  Construction began in 1906, with work completed after just 10 months.  At the time, it was the largest concrete stadium in the world.  Designed to look like the Roman Coliseum, the goal was for the building to be so comprehensive that it could "never become outdated."</p>

<p>Archbold Stadium opened with an initial capacity of 20,000, but had its capacity doubled in 40,000 in the 1950s.  Stricter fire codes, however, required the capacity to be dropped to 30,000.  After the NCAA required stadiums to have a capacity in excess of 33,000 in order to televise games, plans for the demolition of the venue were quickly initiated.  Demolition started immediately after the final home game of 1978, on November 11th, and was completed the following March [1] [2].  Though fondly remembered by many fans of the Orange due to the great success Syracuse teams found in the venue, columnist Jayson Stark remarked on the change from Archbold Stadium to the Carrior Dome that "Aside from the rats in the locker room, the absence of any comfortable seating and the insufficient capacity, it was as fine a facility as any stadium in America" [4].</p>

<p>After being closed due to construction for the 1979 football season, the venue reopened in 1980 as the Carrier Dome.  Initial plans had called for the stadium to be located in a different area, however, locals laid down on the proposed grounds to prevent the start of construction.  Syracuse eventually relented and allowed the stadium to be rebuilt on the site of Archbold Stadium.</p>

<p>Originally named for the Carrier Corporation, which donated $2.75 million of the original $27 million (just over $114 million in 2023) bill for construction, "The Dome" sat about 50,000 spectators, making it the 5th-largest domed stadium in the country at the time of its completion [2].  Though some sites report changes in capacity over this time period, the first major renovation to the stadium from its inception was the 1999 deflation and subsequent replacement of its domed roof; this still had no impact on its capacity, which seems to have always been closer to 49,000 than the 50,000 number originally reported [6].  The roof was again replaced in 2020, this time with a structural (as opposed to air-supported) partly-clear roof as part of a series of stadium upgrades which, ironically, included the addition of air conditioning to the venue for the first time [7].  Plans are currently being finalized to convert sections of the benched seating into seatback chairs in the coming years, however, how this would impact capacity remains unclear [8].  It was renamed in May 2022 for a local mobile phone service, breaking a formerly lifetime contract with Carrier after school officials felt Carrier was not properly keeping up their end of the bargain [13]</p>
