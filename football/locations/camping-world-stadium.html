<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Camping World Stadium opened in 1936 as <b>Orlando Stadium</b>.  Constructed using WPA funding, the stadium was from its onset a neutral venue; it was never a team's primary home venue until 1979, when UCF's football program first organized.  The site began hosting regular bowl games in 1947; when that happened, the stadium rebranded as the <b>Tangerine Bowl</b> in reference to their new bowl game.  It later rebranded to the <b>Citrus Bowl</b> in 1976 for a single season before reverting to its original name for another 5 years.  It reverted to the Citrus Bowl name (with Florida tagged to the front) from 1983 to 2013 before swapping Florida for Orlando for 3 years.  Since that time, it has been named for its corporate sponsor, Camping World [1].</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the stadium has long been a host-site for bowl games.  The first bowl held in the venue was the Tangerine Bowl, which began in 1947; the same bowl continues to be held there, albeit under a variety of different names.  The bowl was sponsored for the first time prior to the 1983 iteration of the game by the Florida Citrus Growers.  It has retained the Citrus Bowl part of its name ever since (except for 2003-2014, when it was named only the Capital One Bowl), albeit with a dizzying array of sponsorships appended to either side of the name; sponsors includes the personal computer brand CompUSA (1994-1999), an early Amazon-styled company called Ourhouse.com (2000), Capital One (2001-2002; this time with Citrus Bowl as part of the name), Buffalo Wild Wings (2015-2017), the waterstore "superstore" Overton's (2018), lodging-website Vrbo (2019-2021), and Cheez-It (2022-present) [2].</p>

<p>The venue has also held a secondary bowl game since 2001, when the MicronPC.com Bowl (n√©e Blockbuster Bowl [Dec. 1990-Jan. 1993] / Carquest Bowl [Jan. 1994-Dec. 1997]) moved from Miami Gardens to Orlando.  When the bowl uprooted, it dropped the MicronPC sponsor (1998-2000) in favor of the then-defunct Tangerine Bowl name, which it retained for three seasons, albeit with a Mazda-sponsored prefix for 2002 and 2003.  It then rebranded as the Champ Sports Bowl (2004-2011), Russell Athletic Bowl (2012-2016), the Camping World Bowl (2017-2019), and the Cheez-It Bowl (2020-2022) and the Pop-Tarts Bowl (2023-present) [3].</p>

<p>In light of the litany of sponsors and the sometimes-confusing naming, I will refer the original bowl as the Citrus Bowl, while the newer, relocated bowl game will be called the Cheez-It Bowl, its name as of the time of this writing.  Of the four games NC State has played at Camping World Stadium, only one was under the guise of the Citrus Bowl, while the last three have been part of the Cheez-It Bowl, which has long been tied to the ACC, featuring just one game without an ACC team (or Notre Dame, who is permitted to take the place of an ACC team) since January 1994.</p>

<p>Orlando Stadium opened in 1936 with a capacity of 8,900 and hosted primarily high school games; in fact, it was owned by the area High School Athletic Association.  Rollins College, of Winter Park, played some of their biggest games on the grounds from the time of its construction until the Tars discontinued football in 1949, but they were obligated to rent the venue from the high schools [4].  The venue grew by 2,000 seats in 1952, and was renovated again in 1968, expanding the stadium's capacity to 15,900 and also adding a press box.  The stadium was heavily renovated from 1974-1976, expanding to 50,612 seats, including an upper deck along the east sidelines.  The renovation was widely ridiculed, however, after it came to light that the job was rushed and featured several engineering missteps, causing the upper deck to sway heavily; in May 1980, the 3,600 seat deck was removed.  In 1989, new concrete upper lecks were added to both sides of the stadium, giving the stadium 65,438 seats.  In 2014, the lower tiers of the stadium were dismantled and redesigned with seat-back<!-- http://stadiumdb.com/stadiums/usa/orlando_citrus_bowl_stadium --> chairs rather than bleachers; since then, the venue's capacity has been 60,219 (expandable to 65,194) [1].</p>
