<body>
<p><b>Baujan Stadium</b> was used by Dayton's football team from 1925-1973; it replaced Varsity Field / University Field (built 1922) and was replaced by Welcome Field, a shared venue off of Dayton's campus that opened in 1949.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State has a record of 1-0 at this field, winning their sole game.</p>

<p>Baujan Field opened in 1925 as <b>Dayton Stadium</b>.  Though plans had been in the works since as early as April 1924, by the close of the following football season, it was needed desperately: athletic attendance had exploded from about 4,000 spectators over the course of the 1920 football season to 34,500 in 1923, and 62,000 in 1924.  This was partially buoyed by the fact that the Flyers had one of the most successful seasons in school history in the former year, going 7-3 against largely major opponents.</p>

<p>The decision to move was not because the field was outdated or because of poor location -- their previous field had only been built in 1922* about scarcely 1,000 feet away from their new venue<!-- https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4084dm.g4084dm_g06671191803/?sp=12&st=image&r=0.29,0.032,1.044,0.476,0 -->.  Instead, it was to celebrate the University's Diamond Jubilee, and part of a larger effort to engender athletics at Dayton.  Plans to open the new gridiron had been fomenting since June 1922, and athletic officials spent much of that football season visiting the preeminent football plants of the region.  The success of the 1924 Flyers actually prompted the University to look bigger; initial plans had called for only one side of the stadium's eventual north-south bleachers to be completed.  Instead, officials expanded their purview to include a venue capable of holding 12-15,000 persons, a size made necessary by the Red and Blue's skyrocketing attendance, which ballooned from just 4,000 persons over the course of the 1919 football season to 34,500 in 1923, and nearly double that the following season [a] [b].</p>

<p>Though preliminary site prep had long since begun, the University naturally included the stadium in their massive 1925 commencement celebration, and they did it with some cachet: head coach Harry Baujan was able to draw his former coach<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/394314043/?match=1&terms=%22baujan%20field%22 -->, famed Notre Dame leader Knute Rockne, to give an introductory speech and assist in the cornerstone laying ceremony.  Calling athletics "an integral part of the educational curriculum," Rockne described sports as "a laboratory where the youth experiments with himself, physically, mentally, and socially."  Echoing some of the most popular talking points of the athletic boom of his era, Rockne went on: "The graduate who has taken part in athletics always has the edge on the student who has not embraced sports.  For they develop some of man's finest qualities, stimulate fairness, square play and resourcefulness that cannot be acquired otherwise" [b] [c].</p>

<p>Located on the site of a former campus ravine (nicknamed The Rubicon) adjacent to the university orchards, construction was finished on schedule ahead of the 1925 season.  Built at a cost of $140,000 (over $2.5 million in 2024), the initial stadium held 8,000 persons, with reinforced concrete bleachers on the north and south sides of the field and a quarter-mile track encircling the playing field and a "massive scoreboard" built at the east endzone.  Beneath the south bleachers were offices and locker rooms for both teams, complete with showers; the northern bleachers were built into a natural slope.  The inaugural game was a 45-0 shellacking of Wilmington College (an Ohio-based private liberal arts school) beneath a dreary sky.  The stadium was not dedicated, however, until October 17th, when a near-capacity crowd watched the Gem City squad take down the rival John Carroll University aggregation 17-to-nothing [d] [e].</p>

<p>Updates to the field after its completion were fairly meager in nature.  Temporary endzone bleachers pushed the capacity to 12,000, and though they became an increasingly regular fixture of the stadium, more permanent changes were few for the first several decades.  New lights were installed in 1929 (the first game was a 33-0 win over Indiana Central Normal on September 28th), and again in 1940 and 1954, and a new scoreboard in 1949; funds were raised via a charity softball game in 1939 to either repair or replace the original one, installed in 1925, but it's not clear what, if any, changes took place [f].</p>

<p>In December 1961, the field was renamed <b>Baujan Field</b> (or, sometimes, <b>Baujan Stadium</b>) in honor of coach Baujan, who coached the Flyers' football team from 1923-1946.  Apparently, the impetus came from an alumnus, Pete Zierfolf: inspired by a muddy slog against Miami (Ohio) Redskins in November 1959, the former Flyers tackle allowed that his Miami Engineering Co. would resod, till, and level his former stomping grounds free of charge, so long as University officials agreed to name it for his former coach.  That same offseason (1960), the seats were painted red and blue, and the locker rooms painted and scrubbed [g] [h].</p>

<p>After several years of languishing success, the Red and Blue hired John McVay (grandfather of Rams coach Sean McVay) in 1965.  The Flyers were in rough shape, having lost 7 or more games in their previous seven seasons, and finished with a winning record only once in the last decade.  After one more season in the doldrums, McVay began working his magic, turning Dayton into one of the most successful team.  More importantly, interest in the team mounted, necessitating the construction of new endzone bleachers.  Located in the east endzone, the seats raised the capacity to 13,888, though period reports noted they added only 505 new seats.  Even with the enlarged capacity, the Flyers sold out their stadium more resoundingly than ever before: "we've had the people in the stadium before and announced them as sellouts," noted Finance Director Jack Brown, "But that's when we were hooked up with a grocery chain and practically gave away tickets" [i].</p>
<!-- https://ecommons.udayton.edu/flyer_news/523/ p7 -->

<p>Though there was "nothing structurally wrong" with Baujan Field, the Flyers were looking to move on; as early as 1968, university officials began looking to move to Welcome Field, a city-owned, high school-constructed field located just over the Great Miami River and adjacent to their basketball venue, Dayton Arena.  Though the main advantages afforded by the new venue were easier motoring access and the opportunity for increased seating, there were other improvements to be found; one writer described them as prison-like.  "At first you didn't know any better," recalled former Flyer receiver Larry Nickels.  "Then you went on the road and saw their locker rooms and you knew."</p>
<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/405218264/?match=1&terms=%22baujan%20field%22 -->

<p>At the time, no one knew the last game held on The Hilltop was the last.  But where there's smoke, there's fire.  "[Baujan Field] needed restoration 30 years ago when I was there," Chuck Noll recalled in 1984.  The upkeep costs were just getting to be too high.  As time went on, the tabled move to a new venue became increasing welcoming -- pun intended.  The city and Dayton finally came together on an agreement to put an artificial turf on Welcome Field -- the final lynchpin in making the move.  The Flyers' final game on campus was an October 27th, 1973 win over Drake [j] [h].</p>

<p>Thus began the slow march to football irrelevance for Baujan Stadium.  Though there were some talks of moving the endzone bleachers to Welcome Field, it was decided the cost to move and re-anchor them was not worth it.  Instead, they were purchased by a Minster, Ohio-based company and donated to a local high school.  In 1981, an arsonist set fire to the aging press box.  The "dank" and "dingy" locker rooms, however, remained in service through 1983, with the football team dressing on-campus before bussing to their new home -- Welcome Stadium's locker rooms held only 50 persons.  In the meantime, the field did continue to host action, primarily Dayton soccer and rugby.  There was some football: the Dayton Colts, members of the semi-pro Midwest Football League, used the stadium as their base of operations in 1975, and some high school athletics took place around that time as well [k].</p>

<p>That continued until the summer of 1984, when an addition to Dayton Arena was built to include football locker rooms.  Flush with cash from a highly successful basketball season and burdened by the need for more intramural fields, Flyers officials pulled the trigger, and Baujan's south stands were pulled down.  The idea was that the space could be used to build two (partial sized) intramural fields, leaving the north stands undisturbed.  Wrecking balls game on December 13th, and the whole thing torn down in about 60 days.  The stands lived on, in a sense: bricks and concrete were ground down and used as aggregate fill for a new parking lot.  It's been difficult to find details on the renovation, but the field was ready by the following October, when it hosted women's soccer in by early October [l] [h].

<p>Soccer has remained the primary user of Baujan Field since then, with intramural sports also continuing to be frequent occupants.  Though the south stands were pulled down, it doesn't appear as if the field was bisected; the plans were initially put on ice because of adverse weather and the retirement of some of the related administrative figures.  The northern bleachers were also likely demolished at this time, but it is unclear -- aerial images <!--https://www.historicaerials.com/viewer-->show they were gone by 1994.  By 1990, the venue returned to intercollegiate play only once Founders Field (located where the RecPlex now stands) was lighted, but bosted no seating <!-- none in 1994 pic -->[m].</p>

<p>Baujan Field has since seen several changes prompted by consistent success on the soccer pitch: in 1999, a new scoreboard was installed on the east side, while a pair of bleacher seats, holding 350 persons, were added to the south side of the field -- these proved insufficient of handling the crowds of over 1,000 watching the Lady Flyers compete against Evansville in the NCAA playoffs; despite the spartan facilities, the 1,517<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/409834155/?match=1&terms=%22baujan%20field%22 --> specators in attendance remain the program's 7th-most as of 2024<!-- https://daytonflyers.com/documents/2024/7/23/WSOC_HistoryGuide_2024_NEW.pdf -->.  The following year, the northern grass berm was converted to terrace seating, affording the venue 2,000 total seated spots at a cost of $500,000 (just under $1 million in 2024).  In 2003, the field was resurfaced; this was done again in 2015 [n] [n1].</p>





<p>* Varsity Field was built just south of their previous, bleacherless home field.  The preceeding field was not named, as best as I can tell.</p>
