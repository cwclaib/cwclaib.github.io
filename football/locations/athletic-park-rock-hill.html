<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In February 1896, the Rock Hill Athletic Association formed on a property belonging to the Oakland Company with the intention of building a horse track.  The Oakland Company was a land acquisition association formed 5 years earlier in an effort to convince Winthrop College to relocate which ultimately proved successful<!--; the main drive to the area was renamed Oakland Avenue-->.  Though details of the construction are scarce, the Athletic Association was hoping to organize a baseball game and a bicycle race by June 15th, in time for Winthrop's first commencement in its new home [1].</p>

<p>The park continued to host baseball games, horse races, and bicycle races for much of its history.  The track was improved in June 1898, and the first known football game on the grounds was held between Clemson and Davidson on October 14th, 1899.  Davidson's first game of the season, they lost 0-10.  NC State (then North Carolina A&amp;M) played just one game on the grounds: their November 18th, 1899 game against Clemson.  It was Clemson's second game of the season on the grounds, and their final game as well.  J. Platt Turner, guard for the North Staters, recalled that the grounds were "a field of slate rock" [2].</p>

<p>The park continued to see action largely for regional baseball and smaller football games (primarily featuring either Catawba Male College or the Kings Mountain Military Academy) for almost a decade, until mid-March 1908, when the Rock Hill Baseball Association elected to move the grand stand and fencing to an existing bicycle track off Hampton Street; the work was complete by March 21st.  The last major usage of the grounds was a Fourth of July Celebration in 1913; this event, which was covered fairly widely in the local paper, was free to attend, and featured two baseball games between "picked" local teams, sprints, and a relay race [3].  That was the final event which can definitely be determined to have been held at the "Oakland" Athletic Park -- by the following Fall, the Hampton Street park was also being referred to ambiguously as the old park, making identification of the two parks difficult.</p>

<p>The announcements for the 1913 Fourth of July celebration indicate that the park was located at the intersection of Oakland and York, though it does not say which corner.  Unfortunately, this area was only captured in the 1916 fire map, and then in no great detail.  In 1907, a large, 7-room cottage on a 100' x 190' lot on both west sides of those corners was sold; a later sale identified this plat of land as lots 13 and 14 on the 1916 Fire Map [4]. <!-- this land, 1001 Oakland, eventually became J E Bass & Sons furniture store, now a 7/11 --> Unfortunately, it is not clear whether the park was on the grounds of Plot 18 or Plot 16.</p>

<!-- wylie store
, and descriptions of the grounds are unclear.  Plot 18 later became the Wylie Store, which occupied the grounds for "several years" until it was moved in 1951, built 1924

<!--
<p>The location of the park is near the grounds of Winthrop University; this is logical, as Oakland was used in order to attract the college.  We also know that it was near the farm of Dr. T. R. Carothers, a Rock Hill physician instrumental in founding the city's first private hospital https://www.rootsandrecall.com/york-county-sc/files/2016/02/ROCK-HILL-PRIVATE-HOSPITAL.pdf; Carothers's farm was "at the turn of Oakland Avenue," which is now India Hook Rd [A] [B].  A 1925 map of Oakland further identifies a Carothers Estate near the intersection of Park Ave Ext and Ebenezer/North Ave [3].  Additionally, it stands to reason that the athletic park would be located near Park Avenue. -->
