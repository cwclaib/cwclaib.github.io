<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In February 1896, the Rock Hill Athletic Association formed on a property belonging to the Oakland Company with the intention of building a horse track [1].  The Oakland Company was a land acquisition association formed 5 years earlier in an effort to convince Winthrop College to relocate; the main drive to the area was renamed Oakland Avenue [2] [3].  Though details of the construction are scarce, the Athletic Association was hoping to organize a baseball game and a bicycle race by June 15th, in time for Winthrop's first commencement in its new home [4].</p>

<p>The park continued to host baseball games, horse races, and bicycle races for much of its history.  The track was improved in June 1898, and the first known football game on the grounds was held between Clemson and Davidson on October 14th, 1899.  Davidson's first game of the season, they lost 0-10 [5] [6].  The last known event on the grounds was a baseball game between Winnsboro and Rock Hill on July 4th, 1907, however no statement on the park's destruction has been located [7].</p> 

<p>The location of the park is on the grounds of what is now Winthrop University; this is logical, as Oakland was organized in order to attract the college.  We also know that it was near the farm of Dr. T. R. Carothers, a Rock Hill physician instrumental in founding the city's first private hospital<!--https://www.rootsandrecall.com/york-county-sc/files/2016/02/ROCK-HILL-PRIVATE-HOSPITAL.pdf -->; Burnett's farm was "at the turn of Oakland Avenue," which is now India Hook Rd [8] [9].  A 1925 map of Oakland identifies a Carothers Estate near the intersection of Park Ave Ext and Ebenezer/North Ave [3].  Additionally, it stands to reason that the athletic park would be located near Park Avenue.  Based on the development of Winthtop, the most logical place for the park to have been would be the present location of Phelps and Lee Wicker Halls.  This area was labeled as Oakland Park on a 1900 map of Rock Hill and was not included as part of Winthrop's campus in 1910, but was by 1916 [10] [11] [12].</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have been unable to find virtually any historic images of Rock Hill from this time, athletic or not.</p>
