	<h2>Camp Davis Athletic Field - Holly Ridge, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Camp Davis Athletic Field</b>, also known as <b>Post Athletic Field</b>, was used by the Camp Davis Archies from 1943 to 1944; it replaced the Marines' use of Wilmington's  <a href="american-legion-stadium.html">American Legion Stadium</a> as a home venue.  The field went disused with the closure of Camp Davis in September 1944, but its exact date of destruction is not known.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 0-1 at this field, losing their one game in front of the largest crowd they played before for the season, more than doubling the next closest viewership, in part due to the game's free admission.</p>

-->

<p>Though Camp Davis played their home games in Wilmington for the 1941 and 1942 seasons, the Marines were unable to make a deal with the city prior to 1943, so began playing on their own post's athletic field [1] [2].  Though the venue likely existed as an informal practice or drill field prior to its use as their primary football field, the venue was first formally constructed in the months leading up to their September 25th, 1943 game against Wake Forest.  The field, located just across the street from camp headquarters<!-- https://archive.org/details/nby_1BH1653 https://web.archive.org/web/20070816005849/http://www.skylighters.org/places/cd3.html -->, was constructed largely by troops stationed at the base.  The grounds opened with a bleacher capacity of 6,000, and were located directly across from camp headquarters [3].</p>

<p>Though the games held at Camp Davis were well-attended, the field was short-lived: in January 1944, the  anti-aircraft artillery battalions (AAA)  suspended operations at the base, and in the fall of that same year the camp buildings and materials were disassembled and/or auctioned off; many of the structures ended up in nearby <a href="https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/v1/clients/wilmingtonnc/WWIIGuidemap_web2_e3dee727-1e4c-4e8b-9191-0db3d33cf3e6.pdf">Wilmington</a>.  The base was used  briefly as an Army Air Force Redistribution and Convalescent Center from January to July, 1945, and was finally fully dismanted in late 1947-early 1948 [4].</p>

	<figcaption>An undated drawing of Camp Davis which I have rotated and modified lightly; the approximate location is marked in red.  Though there is a "ball field" located towards the right edge of the map, and multiple "drill field," a circa 1943 map notes an "Athletic Field" located in area shown above [4]. The road along the bottom is US 17, while NC 50 roughly corresponds with the road leaving the semicircle road in front of the camp headquarters/hospital area [5].</figcaption>
