	<h2>Jack Katz Stadium - Durham, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>Duke's <b>Jack Katz Stadium</b> began life as Duke's multi-use football and baseball field, and served their football team from 1920 (when the program was revived) until 1928; it replaced <a href="trinity-park.html">Trinity Park</a> (aka Hanes Field I) and was replaced by <a href="wallace-wade-stadium.html">Wallace Wade Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 2-0 at this field, playing and defeating Duke both times as true road non-conference games.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Trinity College moved to Durham in 1892, and for the first decade of their scholastic life, Trinity Park (renamed Hanes Field I in 1900) served as their athletic park.  Starting as early as 1906, though, dissatisfaction grew regarding the location of the park, both because it was somewhat difficult to access and because it disrupted "the beauty of the campus."  After several years of inaction, in 1910-11, plans to improve a plot of land just west of campus were combined with a plan to harmonize the layout of the buildings to create a more balanced visual of the campus.</p>

<p>Despite the reported completion of the new athletic zone in 1911, few athletic action took place there; as best as I can tell, the extent of athletic use in the first half decade was for some Fall baseball practice in 1913, supposedly arranged to help determine the best layout for the multi-ues field.  Otherwise, the field appears to have gone disused as construction difficulties plagued the field, ranging from drainage issues to difficulties enclosing the field.  In 1914, the field went unused because the bricks meant to create the fencing were stored on the grass -- and that was after two consecutive brick firms awarded the contract for the fence went under before they could follow through.  Though reports indicated the intention of shifting Hanes Field I's grandstand to the new field, it does not appear as if such a change ever fomented; in September 1914, <i>The Trinity Chronicle</i> sardonically reported that "Once more we hear the time-worn phrase on the campus: New Athletic field to be in use soon... Haste is needed, or the trump of Gabriel will put an end to operations" [1] [2].</p>

<p>Despite their trepidation, the new field was "practically ready" at the time of the students' bitter writing.  The final linchpin was the construction of a grandstand.  Mocking old promises of a stand of concrete construction, a <i>Chronicle</i> writer quipped in early February 1915 that "there is nothing concrete about this grandstand," elaborating that "it exists in theory alone."  Perhaps this barb provided the necessary spark to move the college to action: later that month, it was reported that the baseball diamond and cinder track had already been completed and that a wooden grandstand and two bleachers (holding between 1,000 and 1,400 persons) were being erected, though the more befitting concrete stands would come.  The field, dubbed <b>New Hanes Athletic Field</b>, opened on March 20th, 1914 with a game against Trinity Park School and was dedicated four days later, with Trinity playing host to the University of Vermont's baseball team [2] [3].</p>

<p>Hanes Field was short-lived for a couple reasons.  First and foremost, it was considered too small for much of its life, prompting the construction of Wallace Wade Stadium in 1929.  And secondly, Duke elected to transfer male students to their new West Campus in 1930, leaving Hanes Field primarily for the ladies.  Prior to that time, the stadium was improved a handful of times, with new bleachers for the resuscitated football program arranged in 1920, new dressing rooms and stands were built, seating roughly 4,000 persons<!-- working backwards from 1924... 7.5k/2 = 3,750, rounding up-->.  In 1922, the capacity was "doubled" by the addition of "knock down" bleachers on the north side of the field, to about 7,500<!--working backwards from end... 10k-2.5k = 7.5k-->.  Another couple years later, the field was further enlarged, going over all the old seats and enlarging the southern bleachers; the addition of 2,500 seats put the capacity at 10,000 persons, the venue's final reported capacity.  In the latter work, an up-to-date scoreboard was also added, allowing viewers to find the quarter, score, down, score by quarter, and yards to gain [4].</p>

<p>After the 1930 baseball season, Hanes Field, eschewed by the men, became the domain of Duke's female contingent.  Through the early 1930s and 1940s, this was primarily in the form of field hockey, horseback riding, and campus festivities, ranging from May Day celebrations to fraternity rushes to a freshman initiation ritual called Dink-Bow Day, where women had to wear their clothes backwards and men donned freshman caps.  Perhaps the most major athletic event for the next few decades was in 1936, when Duke's women hosted the US National Field Hockey team [5] [6].</p>

<p>Women's field hockey has remained the most persistent user of the field for much of its life, despite a brief lull in activities in the 1960s.  Indeed, besides stints as the rugby grounds from the late 1960s to 1970s.  Since field hockey was reestablished in 1971, the program has only left the venue from 1990-1995, when the team played at West Campus Turf Field (no longer extant; demolished 2018-19 for Chilled Water Plant No. 3, at the intersection of Anderson St and Bynum Street<!-- 36.003523, -78.929362 -->).  They returned in 1996 after the grounds were upfitted free of charge with an Astroturf surface after the university elected to move all freshman athletics to that area, believing the increased usage would trample the natural grass.  The grounds were upfit with permanent seats about 1999, when it was renamed <b>Williams Field</b><!-- I've been unable to identify exact date or donor name-->; following the 2006 field hockey season, the turf was replaced and 1,500 bleacher seats were added.  In 2008, <b>Jack Katz Stadium</b> was added to the name [7].</p>
