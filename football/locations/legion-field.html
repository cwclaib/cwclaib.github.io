	<h2>Legion Field - Birmingham, AL</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>Birgmingham's staid <b>Legion Field</b> has been used by several schools since it first opened in 1927, though it is most widely remembered as Auburn and Alabama's alternate home site from opening until 1991 and 2003, respectively.  It has also played permanent host to a number of other Yellowhammer programs, including Birmingham-Southern, Samford (formerly Howard), and most recently, the University of Alabama-Birmingham.</p>

<p>The Old Gray Lady, however, is no longer the permanent home to a single college program -- the Blazers left following the 2020 season.  Legion Field is now mostly the site of a number of annual bowl games and classics, including the famous HBCU rivalry Magic City Classic, between Alabama State and Alabama A&amp;M.  It also formerly hosted the (NCAA) All-American Bowl and the Birmingham Bowl; the former relocated to Tampa Stadium, while the latter has moved to the newer Protective Stadium.</p>

<p>NC State played in both of those bowl games during their time in the Magic City, winning once against a ranked team and losing once in an unranked game.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, Birmingham was growing at a rapid rate.  Thanks to a confluence of abundant coal, iron ore, and limestone situated nearby, Birmingham became one of the country's leading steel producers, especially in the south.  In addition to easy rail access, the city was increasing in population precipitously, quadrupling in population between 1890 and 1910.</p>

<p>Legion Field was built on about a quarter of the 40-acre lot which made up McLendon Park, a leisure park in western Birmingham which opened in 1924.  Notably, the city's old public stadium's (Rickwood Field and the State Fair Grounds) were not notably deficient, but the move was pitched as a forward-looking financial investment.  City planners pointed to towards not only the rising popularity of the sport (Georgia Tech had recently drawn over 100,000 spectators in a season, while more locally the Alabama-Georgia game brought over 17,500 fans to Rickwood), but also its increasingly lucrative nature, arguing that the stadium's estimated $150,000 bill (over $2.7 million in 2024) would be paid off in under 10 years.  City planners adopted the measure in late 1926, while work began the following May.</p>

<p>It was expected from the beginning that the field would be a memorial to fallen soldiers, the exact name wasn't decided upon until June.  Despite some weather-related delays in mid-July, the field was still tracking to open for the Fall, though missing the originally-anticipated October opening date.  Made of concrete and steel with a brick finish, the western portion was built up twice as tall as the eastern.  Designed with an eye towards future expansion, it opened with 21,158 seats (or about 25,000 with temporary seats) but a design to hold just under 100,000 in the distant future.  "Mr. [David O.] Whilidin looked far into the future," wrote one paper, but "how far he looked no one can tell."</p>

<p>The stadium also came with all the bells and whistles: a training table, an enclosed glass press box, restrooms, and plans to install a public address system and electric scoreboard.  Several spectators also commented that there wasn't a bad seat in the house, despite its size.  "Birmingham has done the impossible," announced one local citizen. "In the new municipal stadium... I saw what I once thought Birmingham would never have... a monster structure."  Howard and Birmingham-Southern dedicated the plant on November 19th to a crowd of about 16,000, and less than a week later, the Tide swept into the stadium for the first time, nearly filling the structure while hosting Georgia en route to a 6-20 loss [1].</p>
