	<h2>Bobby Dodd Stadium - Atlanta, GA</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Bobby Dodd Stadium</b> (formerly <b>Grant Field</b>) has been used by Georgia Tech from since 1913; it was Georgia Tech's first permanent on-campus home field.  Previously, they had used an amalgamation of Piedmont Park, Brisbane Park, The Flats, and Ponce de Leon Park.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 4-11 at this field, playing all but the first as conference games -- first the Southern Conference, and later as ACC Conference mates.  NC State lost the two games in which they were ranked, and is 2-4 when Georgia Tech has been ranked.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Grant Field was constructed in 1913, on the land which was previously known as The Flats, Georgia Tech's home field from 1905-06 and once again in 1912.  Its 1913 opening date makes the stadium the oldest continuously used on-campus stadium in the FBS.  The original concrete stands, which sat 5,600, were built largely by Georgia Tech students, though other seating options brought the capacity to about 7,000.  By 1919, flush with success under venerated head coach John Heisman, the stadium was expanded to 25,000, and increased by another 5,000 in 1925 with the completion of a horseshoe shape, which surrounded the south, east, and west sides of the field.</p>

<p>In 1944, the west stands were rebuilt to seat 44,000, and by 1958 the bowl was completed.  By adding upper decks to the east and west (1962 and 1968, respectively), the Yellowjackets increased their stadium's capacity by just under 10,000 and by about 5,000 with each renovation to reach an ultimate maximum capacity of 58,121.  The venue's seating dipped significantly in 1986 with the construction of the Wardlaw Center, which required the removal of the seats in the south endzone, lowering the number of seats to 46,000.  Two years later, the stadium structure was formally named for Bobby Dodd, though the field still retained the name Grant Field until 2023, when it was renamed <b>Hyundai Field</b> (though the school may still reserve the right to use the Grant Field name).   In 2001 and 2002, a phased construction process was enacted to create improved club seating and add some bleachers back to the north endzone, resulting in the venue's current capacity of 41,000 in the former year, 43,719 in the latter, and 55,000 upon the completion of work [1] [2].</p>

<p>Selling the naming rights to the field would turn out to be a comparatively minor change with regards to another change implemented following the 2023 campaign.  Starting in April 2024, the Edge Center was slated for destruction, along with two full sections (218 and 219) and a partial section (217) in the north endzone.  While the work lowered the venue's capacity to 51,913, it replaced a fittingly piecemeal building with a new sports center to be named the Fanning Center.  Set to open in 2026, the multi-use structure is expected to house offices, nutrition rooms, a strength-and-conditioning space, a players' lounge, among many other amenities [8].</p>

<p>The Edge Center itself was located in the northeast corner of Bobby Dodd Stadium.  The facility originally opened in 1982, and has had several additions in the following years, including the Hearn Academic Center in 1984.  With the completion of the George Mathews Athletic Heritage Center, the Howard Candler Football Conference Center, the Homer Rice Center for Sports Performance, and the enlargement of the Hearn Center, the entire area was renamed the J.C. "Bud" Shaw Sports Complex, though the name seems to have fallen out of popular use around the turn of the century.  The construction of the replacement Fanning Center is scheduled to be on the same footprint as the existing Edge/Rice Center [9].</p>

The pending destruction of Georgia Tech’s Edge Center and the ensuing construction of the Fanning Center will alter the official capacity of Bobby Dodd Stadium.

Sections 218 and 219, and a part of section 217, in the stadium will be permanently removed to fit the new Fanning Center, a 100,000 square-foot facility, into the northeast corner of the historic venue. Bobby Dodd Stadium’s capacity, starting with the 2024 season, will be reduced from 55,000 to 51,913.

The change in capacity is the first for the venue since 2003, when seating increased from 46,000 to 55,000. Since the start of the 2017 season, the Jackets have played in front of 50,000 fans at home only six times, with four of those six games being against rival Georgia.

Tech season ticket holders whose seats are located in those sections have been notified by Tech’s ticket office and have been offered relocations to other sections of the stadium. Construction work to remove sections 218 and 219, and part of 217, is scheduled to begin this week.

Named for alumnus Thomas Fanning, the Fanning Center was approved by the Georgia Board of Regents in 2022. Tech athletic director J Batt said in March that more than $85 million was raised to construct the building which will house offices, meetings spaces and a player’s lounge for the football program, strength-and-conditioning space, a dining hall, nutrition rooms, sports-science and data-analytics areas, sports -edicine and recovery rooms, a sports-science lab and more.

The Fanning Center is expected to be completed in 2026.

“If you begin and end every decision-making process with, ‘What’s the best for our student-athletes?’ You can never go astray. This building will be the foundation,” Batt said March 25 about the Fanning Center. “If we begin and end on this foundation, we’re in a very good place. We will continue to build that brand back to where it belongs, and this building goes a long way toward that.”

The decrease in capacity is the second major change for Bobby Dodd Stadium in the past nine months. In August, the Georgia Board of Regents approved changing the official name of the stadium to Bobby Dodd Stadium at Hyundai Field.
