	<h2>Bobby Dodd Stadium - Atlanta, GA</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Bobby Dodd Stadium</b> (formerly <b>Grant Field</b>) has been used by Georgia Tech from since 1913; it was Georgia Tech's first permanent on-campus home field.  Previously, they had used an amalgamation of Piedmont Park, Brisbane Park, The Flats, and Ponce de Leon Park.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 4-11 at this field, playing all but the first as conference games -- first the Southern Conference, and later as ACC Conference mates.  NC State lost the two games in which they were ranked, and is 2-4 when Georgia Tech has been ranked.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Grant Field was constructed in 1913, on the land which was previously known as The Flats, Georgia Tech's home field from 1905-06 and once again in 1912.  Its 1913 opening date makes the stadium the oldest continuously used on-campus stadium in the FBS.  The original concrete stands, which sat 5,600, were built largely by Georgia Tech students, though other seating options brought the capacity to about 7,000.  By 1919, flush with success under venerated head coach John Heisman, the stadium was expanded to 25,000, and increased by another 5,000 in 1925 with the completion of a horseshoe shape, which surrounded the south, east, and west sides of the field.</p>

<p>In 1944, the west stands were rebuilt to seat 44,000, and by 1958 the bowl was completed.  By adding upper decks to the east and west (1962 and 1968, respectively), the Yellowjackets increased their stadium's capacity by just under 10,000 and by about 5,000 with each renovation to reach an ultimate maximum capacity of 58,121.  The venue's seating dipped significantly in 1986 with the construction of the Wardlaw Center, which required the removal of the seats in the south endzone, lowering the number of seats to 46,000.  Two years later, the stadium structure was formally named for Bobby Dodd, though the field still retained the name Grant Field until 2023, when it was renamed <b>Hyundai Field</b> (though the school may still reserve the right to use the Grant Field name).   In 2001 and 2002, a phased construction process was enacted to create improved club seating and add some bleachers back to the north endzone, resulting in the venue's current capacity of 43,719 [1] [2].</p>
