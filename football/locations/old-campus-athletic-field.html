<p>Also known as <b>Campus Athletic Field I</b>, this on-campus playing grounds was home to the University of North Carolina's varsity and scrub football teams from 1889* through 1899, when it was replaced with <a href="campus-athletic-field.html">Campus Athletic Field II</a> (aka "New" Campus Athletic Field).  NC State played 7 games at "Old" Campus Athletic Field, losing all of them, including a 0-6 record as a road team, and a 0-1 record when the field was a neutral site.  One game, in 1894, was canceled.  Overall, NC State was outscored 12-228 on this field.  None of the games played here were conference games.</p>

<p>* Note: no home games were played in the Fall of 1888 or the Spring of 1889.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Located near modern-day Bynum Hall, it is not known exactly how long this field was in existence.  Reports of raising funds and constructing fencing for an athletic field in Chapel Hill, concurrent with the construction of a new gymnasium, appeared in March 1893, and the field was ready for use by July [1] [2].  Though it is not immediately clear if these were improvements to an existing athletic field, or if they were for an entirely new field, it appears as if the gym in question was the building referred to as University Gymnasium (1885-1897), which was outmoded in 1895 when improvements to Memorial Hall replaced it [a] [b].  The field was destroyed with the construction of Bynum Hall in 1904-1905.</p>

<p>At present, I have not yet found a digitized period map showing the field or precise descriptions describing its location beyond a handful of newspaper reports and tentatively-correct notes scrawled on the reverse of images (see below).  In 1903 it was announced that a donation was given in the name of W. P. Bynum for the construction of a new building which would "probably be placed on the old athletic field" [3].  Additionally, several images noted that it was near the Carr Building (now the Henry Owl Building) and Smith Hall (now Playmakers Theatre).  Placement has also been aided by the research of James L. Gilbert, a UNC football history enthusiast. See his work <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesleegilbert/52209594061/in/album-72157714440739991/">here</a>.</p></p>

<p>There were repeated talks of turning the remaining parts of the land into tennis courts, starting around the construction of Bynum Hall, though these plans were not acted upon until 1907 [4].</p>

	<figcaption>Photo showing what I believe to be the only picture a football game on the athletic field. Note the similarity in grandstand structure and the solid fencing which surrounds the field. The reverse reads (incorrectly, I believe) "Football U.N.C. about 1904." A second, cropped, copy of this picture, has two captions on the back; the first, crossed out, reads <s>Football game ca. 1904 at old athletic field below Bynum Hall</s> while the replacement text reads "UNC vs Virginia at Norfolk Nov 30 1905."  Given that <a href="https://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/dig_nccpa/id/33527/rec/1">this</a> image also shows the location of the 1905 UNC-UVA game (a well-attended neutral-site game in Norfolk), I think that claim can be summarily dismissed [6]</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Though titled on the reverse "1901 - Line-Up Practice. Louis Graves at quarterback," this image appears to show Campus Athletic Field I in the background.  It wouldn't be unusual for the football team to practice on what was then the Old Athletic Field -- the baseball team did [6] [7]</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Photo showing a dugout along the fencing.  Titled on reverse "Chapel Hill, N.C. Feb. '97 - 'Fletch' Bailey practicing batting." Note that home plate is believed to have been below Smith Hall; as this picture is taken down the 3rd base line, the shadows roughly line up with the time of day you would expect to see at a baseball game at that time of day and at that orientation of the park [5]</figcaption>
