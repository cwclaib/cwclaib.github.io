	<h2>Latta Park II - Charlotte, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Latta Park II</b> was a short-lived athletic park (primarily baseball) used primarily by Charlotte's professional baseball teams, though Davidson played at least one game a season at the grounds, leading some to consider this as a secondary home field for the Red and Black.  It replaced <a href="latta-park-i.html">Latta Park I</a> and was replaced by <a href="wearn-field.html">Wearn Field</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-0 at this field, winning their lone game against the Wildcats .</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>The original Latta Park athletic complex was developed in 1891 on the grounds of the old Mecklenburg Fairgrounds.  Though the lot continued to host local baseball and football as well as fair activities (including horse racing, exhibitions, and the staid midway) for over two decades, the relationship could not last forever.  Put simply, two of the three parties were dissatisfied: baseball fans disliked how far the diamond was from the grandstand (along with its muddy terrain), and Latta had 90-acre of increasingly valuable land tied up in the fairgrounds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for owner Edward Dilworth Latta, the contract for the fair was tied up for a few more years, and despite suggestions fair leadership start looking for new grounds, they had not pulled the trigger on a move.  In the meantime, professional baseball was returning to the Queen City, and the old grounds just weren't going to cut it.  The search started in November 1907; in February, it was announced an old vacant property between the Latta estate and the old grounds was selected as the site of the new ballgrounds.</p>

<p>There was just one small problem: funds.  Seven members of Charlotte's sporting public agreed to make the new park, but only if Charlotte sports fans footed two thirds of the $3,000 (over $103,000 in 2025) bill.  The goal was to lay out a 400' x 460' with a 1,200-1,500 person grandstand just 50' from home plate; it was 380' from home plate to left field, and the shortest outfield distance was just 60' less.  The grounds were used for the first time on April 20th, 1908, when the Charlotte Hornets hosted Roanoke College [1].</p>

<p>After a season of use without an official name, the grounds began to be called <b>League Park</b>.  As best I can find, in fact, they were almost never locally called Latta Park at the time of their actual use, though they are best known by that name now, likely through conflation with its predecessor.  Similarly, a number of modern sources mistakenly report that the 1908 Hornets played at Wearn Field; that was the name of League Park's replacement.  This is hardly surprising: the grounds were used for only four seasons of baseball, and few major football games have been reported [2] [3].</p>

<p>Much like its predecessor, the life of Latta Park II was dependent on two things: Latta's perceived value of his land, and the lease of the Mecklenburg Fair.  When the existing lease drew to a close following the fiery 1912 rendition, Latta moved swiftly, developing the land into Charlotte's Dilworth neighborhood.  As far as I've found, the grounds were never significantly modified.  The nature park was replaced by Lakewood Park, which opened in west Charlotte in 1909; the athletic grounds were replaced by Wearn Field, which was located a mile closer to city center.  Practice for the 1912 baseball season took place on the old grounds, but by April 1912, a new house was being built on the former home of Charlotte baseball [4].</p>

	<figcaption>Several images showing baseball at Latta Park II.  The first is a good detail of the interior of the main grandstand with Charlotte's 1908 Hornets standing in front.  The second (click on the middle image to open in a new tab) is a great panoramic view of the grounds.  The third image is a widely-circulated colorized image of Latta Park II which is often attributed to Latta Park I.  The non-linear grandstand and date (Wikipedia dates the image to 1911) discredit this [6]</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Images of football being played at Latta Park II.  The first three images are from Davidson's game against the University of North Carolina in 1909; though not noted as such in the yearbook, the match with the grandstand is obvious.  The fourth image is from the following year's rematch [7]</figcaption>
