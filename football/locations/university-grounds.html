<p>&emsp;&emsp;<i><a href="index.html">Return to the main page</a></i></p>

<body>
<p><b>University Grounds</b> is a largely-retrospective name applied to Furman's home athletic field during their team's earliest years, about 1890-1906, and once again in 1918.  Furman eventually began to host athletics at local venues (first League Park, then Augusta Street Park, and finally Riverside Park) before opening <a href="manly-field.html">Manly Field</a> in 1919.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 0-0-1 at this field, tying the lone game they played.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Furman holds an important place in the annals of the Palmetto State's football history, having been one of the participants in the state's first college football games, held in December 1889 and January 1890 against Wofford.  Though the Mountaineers, as they were then known, likely practiced somewhere on their own campus, details are scarce.  Reflecting on his time as manager of the football team from 1895-1896, alumnus James A. Hoyt recalled that "material was very scarce; there was no football field to speak of... no proper playing field."</p>

<p>Hoyt is correct in saying there was not a "proper" playing field -- a 1903 report indicated the field had no fence, no grandstand, was difficult to access, and was "encumbered with several trees."  But games were held on campus; the earliest date I have found was for the 1901 Thanksgiving game between Wofford and Furman, which local papers noted was to be held "on the Furman campus" or "on Furman University Grounds" [1].</p>

<p>Though disparate from the University Grounds, it's worth covering League Park briefly.  Unfortunately, there's a gap in digital newspaper coverage of Greenville from 1905-1910, so the exact development of the grounds is somewhat unclear, but starting around 1907, the university developed Furman Baseball Park, along Arlington Ave and Memminger St.  That year coincides with the first season of play of the Spinners, Greenville's local baseball club.  The Spinners rented the grounds from Furman, leading to the venue to also be called League Park.  The grounds were also fit up with a running track, allowing the grounds to play host to an annual high school track meet which proved quite popular.  This continued until 1915, when the grounds were purchased by Henry T. Mills, who parceled the field up and divided it into several tracts of land [2].</p>

<p>After having been used by Greenville-area athletics for about a decade, their sale was impactful: it meant Furman's athletics had to move, as did the Spinners.  It was briefly assumed the Mountaineers would return to their campus digs (after all, funding for Manly Field had begun as early as 1915), but instead, they moved first to Augusta Street Park (1915-1917), and then the new Riverside Park (1917), neither of which NC State's football team visited. In 1918, though, the Baptists returned back to campus due to the unpopularity of Riverside Park, which was mired by locomotive fumes thanks to its location near the railway yard [3]

<p>Period reports are not entirely clear on where the 1918 grounds were.  Preliminary searches indicated that "old diamond at the campus" could be fixed up for a small sum; presumably, this is the same location as the old grounds, but it was not stated as definitively.  Further validating this point is a scathing editorial printed in <i>Furman Hornet</i> complaining of the much-delayed Manly Field project, which opined that:</p>

<blockquote>The old field in question is full of small ditches and washes, and is bordered on all sides by great oak trees, the roots of which grow above the ground in many places, making the playing of baseball and football very difficult and causing many bruises and sprains to the players. The old field is very small, being cooped in on three sides by the city streets and on the other by the buildings of the University. The old field is not surrounded by a fence and when games are played many persons see them without paying the regular admission.</blockquote>

<p>This tirade likely refers to the same trees hemming in the field that the columnist complained of in 1903.  Additional faults to the revived home grounds included the continued lack of most permanent seating (benches were reportedly built for female spectators) and the presence of a non-negligable incline on the baseball diamond's left field side.  Despite (or perhaps thanks to) these shortcomings, the field was pressed into service in short order: the team went from having "no field" in late January 1918 to being game-ready in mid-March.  The field was used through the 1919 baseball season, after which it was replaced by Manly Field [4].</p>

<p>So where was this field, then?  Though I've been unable to locate the field on a period map, we have a few context clues.  The <i>Hornet</i> author's rant hinted that it was an on-campus space closely hemmed in by roadways, and mentions it was developed with the original campus back in 1852.  And though no period descriptions (from either its initial usage or the 1918 revival) have been found, three articles from 1919 and 1920 note it was "in front of the library" and faced by Montague Hall.  That puts the field on the western part of campus, along Howe Street.  Whether the grounds were north or south of Elkin Choice Avenue (modern-day Bradshaw Street) has been determined based on the available images, which largely show the Main Building in the somewhat near background.  The location was slated for beautification and planted with grass in early 1920.  Aerial images make clear the grounds were used either for intramural or practice athletics through at least the late 1960s [5].</p>

<p>Following a boom in enrollment in the wake of World War II, Furman began looking to expand.  In 1955, they opened a third campus (the Women's Campus rounded out the bunch) north of Greenville, holding some classes that fall while continuing to support the older campuses.  The Paladins finally consolidated the university into a single campus in 1961 and decided to lease the old grounds to help pay off the construction debts.  The southern portion of the men's campus was developed in the early 1960s, but it took until late 1968 for construction to start on the land of the former athletic field.  Work on the Bell Tower Shopping Center began in 1968, and the center's first shop opened in 1970.</p>

<p>By 1984, most business had left the development as interest in the mall waned; 3 years later, the buildings were converted to most of Greenville's county government offices in the space, which was re-branded as "County Square."  The old mall buildings were torn down in late 2023 / early 2024 after a new building (also called County Square) was built on the east end of the property; while development is ongoing at the time of this writing, the plan is to build up the area with several retail, restaurant, office, and mixed-use spaces [6] [7].</p>

It is currently mis-attributed as Manly Field c. 1919 on Furman's archives, but note the similarity of the shot to others presented above.

The old athletic grounds are at just south of the upper left part of the building.
