	<h2>Fairview Park - Winston-Salem, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>Though <b>Fairview Park</b> was never a full-time home field for any team, it played host to a handful of major college football games.  It partially replaced <a href="south-side-park.html">South Side Park</a>, and was itself replaced by Prince Albert Park in 1911.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-0 at this field, playing just one non-conference game at the site.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In late 1904, news began percolating that Fries Manufacturing &amp; Power had taken an interest in developing a new park in northern Winston, about two blocks north of the northern terminus of their street car line.  With a coverage of 3-5 acres, it was intended to host football and baseball, and was said to be much more suitable for sports than other local athletic venues.  Located just east of the Norfolk &amp; Western tracks, it was also tabbed for hosting traveling shows and circuses.</p>

<p>Construction began in earnest in mid-March 1905, with plans to lay off a diamond "strictly in accordance with the rules of the National League," as well as a "standard" football ground and a grandstand seating 500 persons; this was located in the north side of the grounds.  The baseball teams of Davidson and Washington &amp; Lee were meant to inaugurate the new park with a baseball game on April 6th, but rain forced the match to be relocated to South Side Park.  Instead, the first game was between NC State and Davidson's baseball nines on April 13th; the Farmers lost 1-6 [1].</p>
