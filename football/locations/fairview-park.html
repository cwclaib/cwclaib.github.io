	<h2>Fairview Park - Winston-Salem, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>Though it was never a full-time home field for any college team, <b>Fairview Park</b> played host to a handful of major college football games.  It partially replaced <a href="south-side-park.html">South Side Park</a>, and was itself replaced by Prince Albert Park in 1911.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-0 at this field, playing just one non-conference game at the site.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In late 1904, news began percolating that Fries Manufacturing &amp; Power had taken an interest in developing a new park in northern Winston, about two blocks north of the northern terminus of their street car line.  With a coverage of about 5 acres, it was intended to host football and baseball, and was said to be much more suitable for sports than other local athletic venues.  Four out of the five total properties which eventually encompassed the park were purchased in November 1904; the final plot (mostly the southern half of lots 16, 18, 20, and 22 on the map below) was purchased in July 1906 [1] [2].</p>

<p>Construction began in earnest in mid-March 1905, with plans to lay off a diamond "strictly in accordance with the rules of the National League," as well as a "standard" football ground and a grandstand seating 500 persons; this was located in the north side of the grounds, likely in the northwest corner (to maximize space lost from the then-unsold lot).  The baseball teams of Davidson and Washington &amp; Lee were meant to inaugurate the new park with a baseball game on April 6th, but rain forced the match to be relocated to South Side Park.  Instead, the first game was between NC State and Davidson's baseball nines on April 13th; the Farmers lost 1-6 [1].</p>

<p>Though the grounds hosted Carolina League baseball action in 1905 (after Salisbury's team was relocated to Winston-Salem mid-season), there was no professional baseball on the grounds again until 1908.  Starting in February of that year, the grounds were thoroughly done over: the fences moved to enlarged the diamond, bleachers were added, the grounds were generally leveled, the grandstand was moved to the southeast, "at the left of the front entrance."  In May, a scoreboard was added, though it lasted scarcely more than one season [3].</p>

<p>By November, the park was divided up into lots and sold by the Home Real Estate, Loan, &amp; Insurance Co. (HREL&amp;I), with almost all of the lots sold by the turn of the decade.  There were a handful of games held as late as July 1909, but fairly soon after that, the grounds were no more; by 1910, the area was reported to be "a thriving residence location, with an engine house [fire department], city market and a number of prosperous stores."  By 1917, the entire land was developed.  As will be seen in the images below, however, the formerly-thriving district has been entirely demolished and rebuilt.  The six westernmost homes were demolished during the construction of US-52 in the late 1940s, while most of the remainder fell between 1980-2000 [4].</p>

<h2>Pictures of Fairview Park</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, at this time there are no known historic images of Fairview Park.  I do, however, have pictures of the site I took in February 2025, which show the site's idealness for an athletic venue.</p>

	<figcaption>A February 2025 image of the site taken from the 16th St bridge, facing east.  A Citgo gas station (at right) was built on the site in 1984, replacing an earlier service station built about the 1960s (see <a href="https://mapf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=034229a5dc3a401a90ff7bd23d04ffc9">Forsyth County Historical Imagery Viewer</a> for more details) [6]</figcaption>
