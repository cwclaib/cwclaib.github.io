	<h2>Fairview Park - Winston-Salem, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>Though <b>Fairview Park</b> was never a full-time home field for any team, it played host to a handful of major college football games.  It partially replaced <a href="south-side-park.html">South Side Park</a>, and was itself replaced by Prince Albert Park in 1911.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-0 at this field, playing just one non-conference game at the site.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In late 1904, news began percolating that Fries Manufacturing &amp; Power had taken an interest in developing a new park in northern Winston, about two blocks north of the northern terminus of their street car line.  With a coverage of 3-5 acres, it was intended to host football and baseball, and was said to be much more suitable for sports than other local athletic venues.  Located just east of the Norfolk &amp; Western tracks, it was also tabbed for hosting traveling shows and circuses.</p>

<p>Construction began in earnest in mid-March 1905, with plans to lay off a diamond "strictly in accordance with the rules of the National League," as well as a "standard" football ground and a grandstand seating 500 persons; this was located in the north side of the grounds.  The baseball teams of Davidson and Washington &amp; Lee were meant to inaugurate the new park with a baseball game on April 6th, but rain forced the match to be relocated to South Side Park.  Instead, the first game was between NC State and Davidson's baseball nines on April 13th; the Farmers lost 1-6 [1].</p>

<p>Though the grounds hosted Carolina League baseball action in 1905 (after Salisbury's team was relocated to Winston-Salem mid-season), there was no professional baseball on the grounds again until 1908.  Starting in February of that year, the grounds were thoroughly done over: the fences moved to enlarged the diamond, bleachers were added, the grounds were generally leveled, the grandstand was moved from the northeast corner to the southeast, "at the left of the front entrance."  In May, a scoreboard was added, though it lasted scarcely more than one season [2].</p>

<p>By November, the park was divided up into lots and sold by the Home Real Estate, Loan, &amp; Insurance Co. (HREL&amp;I), with several sold by the turn of the decade.  There were a handful of games held as late as July 1909, but fairly soon after that, the grounds were no more; by 1910, the area was reported to be "a thriving residence location, with an engine house, city market and a number of prosperous stores."  Further backing up my belief that by 1908 the grandstand was in the southeast corner of the park was that virtually all of the land in the northeast corner of the park was sold in 1909 when those last two games were taking place.  By 1917, the entire land was developed [3].</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at this time there are no known images of Fairview Park.</p>
