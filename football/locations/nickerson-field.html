<p>The land encompassing <b>Nickerson Field</b> has been used by Boston University since 1953; it replaced Fenway Park, which had seen use as the school's main athletic venue since 1947, after their former home grounds were destroyed for a highway [1].</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-0 at this field.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>The field began its life in August 1915 as <b>Braves Field</b>, and saw use by the Boston Braves from that date until 1952, when the team was purchased by Milwaukee.  A golf course until 1912, construction began in March 1915 and was completed by August.  One of the largest stadiums of its era, Braves Field opened with a 40,000-spectator capacity.  Considered by baseball enthusiasts as the last classic "Jewel Box ballpark," Braves Field boasted two-tiered concrete and steel grandstands and a pitcher-friendly stadium design; it wasn't until 1922 the first out-of-the-park homerun was hit [2].</p>

<p>Though Braves Field (briefly renamed <b>National League Park</b> from 1936-1941) saw some renovations, such as the addition of lights in 1946, and sporadic fence adjustments after the end of the dead ball era in 1921, the venue was otherwise largely original at the time of the Boston Braves' flight to Milwaukee.  The Boston University Terriers played in the largely-unmodified ballpark from 1953-55 [2] [3].  For the first year the Terriers played at the field, it was still known by the name of its former occupants; a contest to rename the venue, offering a $100 cash prize (just over $1,000 in 2023) was announced only in late September 1953, just over a week before their first home game, and the name not changed to the incredibly-creative <b>Boston University Field</b> until April 1954; I can see how it took nearly a year to come up with that zinger of a name [4] [5].</p>

<p>In 1955, the famed "Jury Box" (noted the "Center Field Bleachers" in the 1916 seating diagram below) and the third base pavilion were demolished, leaving only the grandstands and the first base pavilion; some consider this scope of demolition to have resulted in a new field, usually called Braves Field/Boston University Athletic Field.  This remained the case through November 1959, when the grandstands were removed to make way for a series of new dormatories; as part of the change, the remaining first base pavillion was enlarged.  Some consider this renovation to have resulted in yet another field, called Boston University Field/Nickerson Field II.</p>

<p>In 1963, the field was renamed for BU Board of Trustees member William Emery Nickerson, who was instrumental in the creation of the Gillette safety razor.  This park was technically the second field of Boston University's to bear that name, with a first having been built in nearby Weston in 1928, but the land of the original was claimed under eminent domain for the construction of a state highway.</p>

<p>In 1968, the original 1946 Braves Field light towers were dismantled and removed, and the playing surface changed from grass to AstroTurf, making the Terriers just the second college in the country to change to the synthetic surface.  Following the 1997 season (a disastrous 1-10 campaign which followed a decade of increasingly-precipitous results), Boston University discontinued their football program.  Though no longer used as a football venue, the stadium continued hosting other Terriers sports, as well as local minor league teams from a variety of sports, including soccer, lacrosse, and rugby.  In 2001, the surface was replaced with FieldTurf; this was replaced again in 2015 with GreenFields MX Trimension, another synthetic product [6].</p>
