<p>Washington's Central High School was built from 1914-1916 to replace Washington High School, the city's first high school, which opened in 1882.  The plans for the school started in 1914 with an expected cost of $1.2 million (almost $36.5 in 2023) and included "an athletic field adjoining" the new school grounds.  Plans called for a 6,000-seat stadium measuring 600' x 450' for football, baseball, and track and field usage, with a 1/6-mile track encircling the grounds [4].  The cornerstone of the new building was laid in November 1914 [5].</p>

<p>When the school opened in 1916, the new football grounds were yet to open.  Though all the work was complete, "foot ball [sic] is not to be allowed, because of the possibility that the new turf might be torn up and injured permanently"; students used nearby American League Park as much as posisble in its place  [1] [2] [3].  The field finally opened to the public for the first time on May 11th, 1917 for a track meet between area high schools, and held its first football action on Friday, September 28th; Central defeated Baltimore City College 64-0 [6] [7].</p>

<p>In 1923, the stadium was renamed the <b>Emory M. Wilson Memorial Stadium</b> in honor of the school's former principal, who led the school for 18 years [8].  Before the 1950 school year began, the body of Cardozo High School, a black business high school, was relocated to the building of Central High School, which was an all-white comprehensive school.  This took place primarily because Cardozo's old building was overcrowded, while Central's was underfilled [9] [10].  The field appears to have been renamed <b>Cardozo Stadium</b> when this took place, and was renamed <b>Sal Hall Stadium</b> in 1986 to honor the school's long-time track and field coach, Sylvester R. "Sal" Hall [17].</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I've been unable to find many details of specific renovations to the venue.  The school has a unique sideways horseshoe design, which is has retained since its opening.  Various area colleges used the grounds from time to time through about the 1930s, including American, Catholic, and George Washington, but it was never a home field for any of the schools.</p>
