<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>The Orange Bowl had seen heavy use since it first opened in the 1930s, hosting the University of Miami, a post-season bowl game, and, starting in 1966, the NFL's Miami Dolphins.  While the venue was aging, the main impetus to build a new venue, according to former Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, was a 4-times increase in rent levied by the City of Miami in 1976.  By December 1985, ground was broken on the venue, which was built with future baseball expansion in mind.</p>

<p>The privately-funded $115 million (about $313 million in 2023) <b>Joe Robbie Stadium</b> opened its doors for the first time in August 1987, hosting a pre-season NFL game between the Dolphins and the Bears.  The 75,000 seat venue hosted its first college football game, the Blockbuster Bowl, three years later, pitting Penn State against Florida State on December 28th, 1990.  The bowl game was spearheaded by Blockbuster owner Wayne Huizenga, who had just purchased a 50% stake in the stadium.</p>

<p>In 1991, Miami was awarded a Major League Baseball expansion franchise, and Joe Robbie's baseball-ready stadium was the natural landing place.  The Marlins moved in by April 1993.  Retractable bleachers were added around the stadium to allow for conversion of the site on baseball gamedays, but otherwise the capacity did not change.  In 1996, the stadium was named <b>Pro Player Stadium</b> after Fruit of the Loom's sports brand after Huizenga gained full rights to the stadium.  In 1999, luxury suites were added</p>

<p>The stadium was renovated in 2005, at which time it was renamed <b>Dolphins Stadium</b>, Fruit of the Loom having declared bankruptcy and liquedated the Pro Player Brand several years ago.  The aforementioned renovation constituted the construction of two large pavilions to the east and west sides of the stadium; from 2009-2010, similar work was done to the southern end of the stadium.  The second renovation also coincided with a new naming deal; this time, the name paid homage to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville beer, and was named <b>Land Shark Stadium</b>, but was renamed <b>Sun Life Stadium</b> in 2010 after just over six months.</p>

<p>Displeased with the venue's quality as a baseball stadium, the Marlins left after the 2011 baseball season.  At the same time, NFL executives vowed the stadium, which had already hosted five Superbowls, would receive no more unless it was improved, primarily by adding a roof and by improving luxury suites.  In 2013, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross unveiled plans to renovate the stadium significantly.  Work began following the 2014 season, and included shortening the cavernous sidelines by moving the stands 24 feet closer to the field, and removing seats in the corners of the upper sections; the work reduced the stadium's capacity to 65,326.</p>

<p>Between the 2015 and 2016 football seasons, the aforementioned roof was constructed as an open air canopy, and new video boards were added. Just before the 2016 football season, the venue was renamed <b>Hard Rock Stadium</b>, which is expected to be the field's most enduring name in history once the current deal, which runs through 2034, expires [1] [2] [3].</p>
