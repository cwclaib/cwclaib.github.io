<p>Atlanta's Athletic Park -- sometimes called Athletic Park II to differentiate it from an earlier park -- was very short-lived athletic park used by the Southern Association baseball team of the city, the Atlanta Atlantas (later the Crackers) from April 1894 through March 1895.  The grounds were built on a long-undeveloped field between Jackson Street and Wheat Street by Atlanta's Consolidated Street Railroad Company, who sponsored the construction of a rail route to the field, in addition to outfitting it with grandstands and fences [1].  At first, the construction of the field stalled due to an injunction from nearby residents, however, a judge ruled in favor of allowing the construction of "the prettiest ball park in the south."  Work was completed in just a handful of days, with the first pitch taking place on April 7th [2] [3] [4].  Just over a month after the park opened, the Conslidated company outfitted the park with a horse race track added electric lights to the field, bright enough so that "there will not be an inch of the track that will be out of sight at any time" [5].</p>

<p>In addition to the Atlantas' baseball games and the horse races, the Georgia Tech football team played their home games in the park in 1894; they might have also played there in 1895, had they fielded a team.  Instead, the field hosted a handful of important games, including an exciting game between Virginia and Vanderbilt, who were in the thick of competing for champion of the South.  By March 1896, however, the the newly-renovated Brisbane Park had reopened, and the Atlantas chose not to renew their contract on the park; instead, they were renovating a new park in the Ponce de Leon area (not, notably, the Ponce de Leon Park -- later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponce_de_Leon_Park">Spiller Park</a> -- which opened in 1907, though it may have been a more minor forerunner).  By January 1896, the grandstands had been removed, supposedly for the new park, however arrangements stalled, and the Atlantas spent the following season back at Brisbane park; it is not known what became of the disassembled stands [6] [7].  Apparently, part of the wrangling over location was caused by competing railcar companies [8].</p>

<p>Eventually, however, Brisbane Park was selected as the Atlantas' replacement for Athletic Park; the renovated park was said to be yet again the best in the South.  A man named Darwin Jones, a local baseball aficionado of some repute, said "Those grounds on Jackson Street were thought to be the best Atlanta had ever had when they were thrown open. And they were good grounds, about the best Atlanta had ever seen up to that time, because they were large and roomy. But they don't compare with these except in size.  I had no idea such a change could be made [to the grounds]."  It appears that Athletic Park was gradually abandoned [9].</p>

<p>Because the grounds never appeared on a printed map, its location has been determined from written descriptions of its whereabouts.  In addition to the description of its opening, the 1895 Atlanta city directory described the location as follows: "<i>Athletic Park</i> &mdash; Jackson near Edgewood. Baseball, etc." [1] [12].</p>

<h2>Pictures of Athletic Park</h2>

<p>These are, as best as I can find, the only two known images of Athletic Park, both from the 1895 Virginia-Vanderbilt game.  The Cavaliers claimed themselvs "champions of everything" following the season, though Vanderbilt bitterly noted that the game "was lost only by the slender margin of a disputed decision".</p>
