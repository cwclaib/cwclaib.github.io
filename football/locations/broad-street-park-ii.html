	<h2>Broad Street Park (II) - Richmond, VA</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Broad Street Park (II)</b> was used by the Richmond Spiders from 1913-1916; it replaced <a href="broad-street-park-i.html">Broad Street Park (I)</a> and was replaced by a combination of <a href="boulevard-field.html">Boulevard Field</a> and Richmond's home field, built in 1914 but rarely, if ever, used for football during that time.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 0-1 at this field, losing their sole game, which was played as a neutral site nonconference game.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>After years of baseball on a somewhat precarious site, leased from a group of railroads on land which they planned to expand onto eventually, the inevitable happened, and in Deember 1912 Broad Street Park was moved a few blocks down Broad Street.  The boundaries of the new location, comprising the northeastern portion of the original location of the Hermitage Golf Course, could be found as follows: "starting at the eastern extremity of the Hermitage Golf Club and stepping off in a westerly direction 400 yards, then forming a right angle with the line thus marked, stepping off 400 more yards to the north, and so on, completing the square and arriving at the starting point" [2] [5].  Modern research locates the park more specifically "on Broad at the intersection with Addison Street" (now Strawberry St) [3].</p>

<p>The new park notably did not plan to use the old, dilapidated stands and bleachers from the previous location, with early plans calling for concrete and iron, though it seems as if that idea was tied into plans to play on the State Fair Grounds which did not come to fruition [4].  The new grandstands did actually receive the press boxes which the first park promised but failed to deliver on (much to the delight of the local press -- their addition was heavily covered), as well as an up-to-date clubhouse with extra room between lockers, as well as hot and cold showers [6] [7].  I found no period estimate of the size of the new grandstand, but it was generally agreed to be slightly- to moderately-larger than the old one; retrospective research indicates it held 1,987 spectators, with the park holding an additional unspecified amount of bleacher seating [8] [3].  The clubhouse generally lagged behind construction; so much so that team manager Steve Griffin "fell through the incomplete clubhouse [floor] and cracked his ribs" on the first day of practice [3].</p>

<p>The park may have opened on March 15th -- several advertizements were made regarding a game of baseball between the Virginia Medical College and the Richmond Blues, a military organization -- but no post-game reports have been found (<a href="https://archive.org/details/xray1913medi/page/154/mode/2up">VMC's yearbook</a> reports no such game, but does note a game against McGuire's School which cannot be located in Richmond papers).  Otherwise, the first game was one held on March 18th between the Medicos and the Union Theological Seminary; the Presbyterians won by an astounding thirty to nothing [9].</p>

<p>Though the park was still fairly new in December 1914, when Richmond brought the Climbers (formerly the Baltimore Orioles) of the International League to town, the park was upgraded significantly, with the grandstands expanding to seat 2,546, as well as an up-to-date clubhouse with accomodations for visiting teams, in addition to the implementation of turnstiles.  The expanded stadium's capacity was about 7,500 [3].</p>

<p>The International League's expansion to Richmond, largely caused by the incursion of the Federal League upon the Baltimore, proved to be chaotic, as the Baltimore Terrapins folded; that brought the Climbers back to Baltimore, where the resumed being known as the Orioles.  With the Climbers' departure in December 1915, the former team manager, Jack Dunn, convinced the Jersey City Skeeters to relocate to Richmond, but then took the best players and reclaimed his spot in Baltimore, leaving a barren team behind in Richmond [3].</p>

<p>In February 1917, the park's 3-year lease with the local railroad interests came to an end, just as it had been in 1912, so the companies could expand; this time, the railroads were constructing a new rail passenger terminal -- this became Broad Street Station.  The local sports teams were forced to move once again, this time to Boulevard Field.  To help prevent the same issue from rearing its head again, the Climbers' ownbership, led by Ben W. Wilson, became the sole owner of the grounds [3].</p>
