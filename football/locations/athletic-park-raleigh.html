<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Raleigh's Athletic Park was first constructed in late February 1889 by the Raleigh Athletic Association, which was organized around the same time.  Located "at the northern terminus of the street car line," the area was reported to be "quite a large plat of land" [1].  The first known game on the grounds was the University of North Carolina's first ever win in a football game, their March 1st, 1889 thirty-three-to-nothing mauling of Wake Forest; organized at the same time as the public announcement of the Raleigh Athletic Association, the grounds were so new that, concurrent with game's announcements ran Editor W. C. Dowd's lukewarm declaration, "I think the grounds will be in fine condition" [2].</p>

<p>Built at first with just stands and seats, by early April Raleigh's independent city team was organized, fences had been built, the buildings whitewashed, and the grounds regraded [3] [4].  The next noted improvements to the grounds were in November 1891, when, ahead of the Wake Forest-North Carolina football game, "ample room" was "reserved for those who go [to the game] in carriages -- the whole side of the grounds in left and centre field being reserved for that purpose" [5].</p>

<p>For over a year afterwards, however, the only talk of the grounds in the papers besides game announcements were complaints of the field's deteriorating condition [6] [7] [8].  By 1894, the grounds were purchased by the local street car company, who promised to keep it in good order.  It was noted by September that it was still not "in proper order" [9] [10].  Apparently, the team considered moving locations, though the search was not well detailed [16].  By March 1895, however, it was repaired and "in fine order," and in July 1896 a new grandstand had been constructed [11] [12].  It was again repaired in 1897, making it "one of the best parks in the south" [13].  By January 1898, however, the grounds were torn down.  The reason remains unclear; all we know is that the city was "for the first time in fifteen years without a park for baseball games," and that a Thanksgiving football game between Shaw and St. Augustine was advertized as the final game on the grounds [14] [15].</p>

<p>Though the grounds have not been located on a historical map of Raleigh, there are several descriptions of their location.  First and foremost is the quote from the introductory paragraph, stating that the field was at the northern terminus of the street car line; the car lines gave another clue to its location in 1892, when the cars were expanded to reach Brookside Park -- "The cars going to the park will descend the present heavy grade to the entrance of the [Oakwood] cemetery, but in returning they will go around the north way by Athletic Park into Blount Street." This suggests a route south of Oakwood Avenue (assuming a <a href="https://www.carolana.com/NC/Transportation/railroads/nc_street_railways_raleigh_map_1914.html">1914 street railway map</a> is fairly similar) [17].  A few years after the park's desruction, an article mentioned an abandoned well "in Idlewild, between the Soldiers' home and Oakwood cemetery -- almost where the old baseball park used to be" [18].  Oakwood Cemetery still remains, while the (Conferederate) Soldiers' Home was located at the intersection of Tarboro St and New Bern Ave.  The final hint towards the park's location is a more cheery one: when the land was sold in 1901, a Mr. O'Quinn intended to turn the land into a nursery for growing flowers; the writeup on the land's sale noted that he was considering building a house on the portion of the 4-acre parcel along Swain St [19].</p>

<p>To this point, no photos of Athletic Park have been positively identified.</p>
