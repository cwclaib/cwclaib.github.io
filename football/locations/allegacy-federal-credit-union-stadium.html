	<h2>Allegacy Federal Credit Union Stadium - Winston-Salem, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Allegacy Federal Credit Union Stadium</b> has been used by Wake Forest since 1968; it replaced <a href="bowman-gray-stadium.html">Bowman Gray Stadium</a>.  It was originally named <b>Groves Field</b> before the university secured corporate naming rights in 2008, renaming the venue <b>BB&amp;T Field</b>.  After just over a dozen years, BB&amp;T merged with SunTrust bank, becoming Truist; the venue was renamed <b>Truist Field</b> in 2020, and retained the name through 2023, when the current corporate partner took over the stadium's naming rights.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 14-14 at this field, playing every game as a true conference road game.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>When Wake Forest left the town to which they owe their name in 1956, it was obvious they would be getting a new stadium -- having a home stadium over 100 miles away was clearly not a logical move.  Though the decision to relocate was made in 1946, and construction on their new campus in 1952, the construction of a new stadium was repeatedly delayed.  Early reports were optimistic the Deacons would move to the Twin City with a new stadium ready: indeed, brothers Henry and Earl Groves, Gastonia-based regional textile magnates, donated $50,000 (almost $685,000 in 2023) towards the effort in 1947.  By 1948, chief architects had been selected, and a rendering of the proposed 50,000-plus seat stadium was circulated in 1950 [1] [2].</p>

<p>The construction remained delayed for almost 2 decades as unforseen costs arose during the move; as early as 1954 it was expected the Demon Deacons would call Bowman Gray home [3].  In 1966, the drive for a stadium of their own was started anew, primarily due to the small size of Bowman Gray, coupled with the fact only about half of the venue's low capacity was considered to be good for accomodating football.  The drive was formally launched during the 1966 NCAA basketball tournament with a 15-minute telecast featuring interviews with alumnis such as Arnold Palmer and shots of both the old Groves Stadium and more recent football action [4] [5].</p>

<p>The drive raised $1.5 million, less than half of the anticipated price tag, but enough for the school to start construction.  Though low, the need for a new stadium was considered dire: "We either need to get a new stadium," said athletic director Gene Hooks, "or get out of the [Atlantic Coast] conference."  Hooks explained that a new stadium and its associated revenue would help bring in more scholarships, reduce travel, and bring larger games to the area [6].  Though widely reported when the brothers first made their donation in 1947, it was not formally announced until September 7th, 1968 -- less than a week before the facility's first game -- that the new venue would be named again for the Groves family: Henry, Earl, and L. Craig Groves, as well as Herman Groves, Sr., for whom the first Groves Stadium was named [7].</p>

<!-- costs https://www.newspapers.com/image/940621514/?terms=%22groves%20stadium%22%20fieldhouse&match=5 -->

<p>The 31,500 seat venue was dedicated on September 14th, 1968, with a game against NC State.  The event was a grand homecoming day for Wake Forest faithful, featuring a pre-game flag raising by former WFU star fullback Andy Heck, who was injured in Vietnam, as well as several former mascots and cheerleaders.  Reverend Dr. Leon Hollingsworth blessed the stadium with an invocation which read, in part: "Trees have grown here, tall and strong, to weather storms and draw strength from the land to give their shade and cast their fruit, and to scatter the seed of their kind upon the winds for building growth in other places. Grant now that men shall grow here, tall also, and strong, in the stewardship of their strength and ability, to give fruit of their increase to the world" [8] [9].  Unfortunately for the Baptists, the game did not go according to plan: the game remained scoreless through halftime, and the Wolfpack scored the game's first 10 points.  The Old Gold and Black scored their lone touchdown on an empty clock in the 4th quarter, but failed the two-point conversion, losing 6-10.</p>

<p>The stadium has never been significantly enlarged, and saw almost no notable renovations for its first two decades of usage.  It was constructed with lights, gold-colored aluminum seats<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/196327994/?terms=%22groves%20stadium%22%20%22field%20house%22&clipping_id=87400745 -->, a sound system, and, of course, a scoreboard.  The latter was the first noted renovation the stadium saw, with the old one being replaced by a computerized scoreboard before the 1981 football season; in 1993<!-- or 1993? https://www.newspapers.com/image/942743479/?terms=%22new%20scoreboard%22%20%22groves%20stadium%22&match=7 -->, it was replaced again, in conjunction with improvements to the stadium lighting.  The following season brought structural improvements and a new paint job to the stands [10].  A new video scoreboard was installed ahead of the 2000 football season, and in 2005 the whitewashed walls were replaced with a brick surface finish.  Yet another new scoreboard was installed in 2011 [25] [5].</p>

<p>One improvement did come to the area supporting the stadium before that 1981 scoreboard refresh: improvements to the stadium field house.  The structure, which sat on the north side of Grove Field, <!--could not find cost-->went unnamed from its construction in 1968 until 1972, when it was expanded and renamed Bridger Fieldhouse, in honor of James A. and Dr. Dewey H. Bridger, brothers from Bladenboro; James was an industriallist, political leader, and owner of a car dealership, while Dewey was a long-time area doctor [11].  The two-story building housed dressing rooms on the first level, while the second functioned as a team dorm the night before games, as well as a meeting place and an interview room.  The 1972 expansion, which included the construction of a 12-foot wide deck around the front side of each level, was prompted after membership to the Stadium Club exceeded the building's occupancy, forcing some members to sup their pre-game meals in a tent outdoors [12].  The revamped fieldhouse was dedicated at the NC State game that season -- the Deacons again lost the dedicatory game.</p>

<p>In 1995, it was announced that the old Bridger Fieldhouse would be coming down; in its place, a new $6 million (just over $12 million in 2023) fieldhouse would be built, housing larger locker rooms, a multi-purpose banquet facility, an athletic hall of fame, and department offices.  Renovations took place over the 1996 season, and at one point required visiting teams to dress in nearby Joel Coliseum and take their halftime break in a tent; work was completed before the 1997 season.  The Bridger name was retained [13].</p>

<p>In 2006, the stadium's turf, which had always been natural grass, was replaced with FieldTurf.  The following year, the original pressbox which sat atop the west stands was replaced with McCreary Tower, a massive seven-story pressbox which also houses luxury suites, club seats, and private boxes, in addition to new spaces for the press and athletic directors.  Construction was completed just prior to the 2008 football season [5].</p>

<p>Since 2008, temporary bleachers and/or club seating have also been constructed in front of Bridger Fieldhouse in the north endzone.  While 2011 images <!-- https://dxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net/sidearm.nextgen.sites/wakeforestsports.com/images/2011/3/21/facility-main-bbt.jpg https://amplo-am.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Wake+Forrest/Club+1.jpg -->show that the only stretched about 2/3 the width of the fieldhouse, my visit to the stadium in 2021 showed that the stands have been widened to expand from one side of the stadium to the other.  Seat access seems to be limited to premium or club seats.</p>
