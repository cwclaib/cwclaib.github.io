	<h2>Campus Athletic Field - Chapel Hill, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p>The "New" Campus Athletic Field (often refered to as <b>Campus Athletic Field II</b>) was an on-campus playing field used by the University of North Carolina from 1900 through 1914, when it was replaced with Class Field, and later Emerson Field; it, in turn, replaced <a href="old-campus-athletic-field.html">"Old" Campus Athletic Field</a> (aka Campus Athletic Field).  NC State played 2 games at Campus Athletic Field II, going 0-1-1, playing every game as a road team.  Two games were canceled, both in part due to eligibility disputes.  The match in 1900 was canceled over UNC's refusal to abide by <a href="../conferences/North-Carolina-Athletics-Association.html">North Carolina Athletics Association</a> rules, while the 1906 game was canceled after Chapel Hill protested the eligibility of NC State's players.  Overall, NC State was outscored 6-45 on this field.</p>

<p>Work began on the new Campus Athletic Field in September 1899, with land "being cleared and leveled on the south-eastern part of the campus" [1].  Construction went slow enough, however, that it was not ready in time for baseball season in January, but was ready by the start of the 1900 football season [2] [3].  In 1905, it was announced that funds had been secured to enlarge the field, and while some work was done, it progressed at a slower pace than expected due to an apparent difficulty in contracting workers.  This caused a stoppage in work starting late January 1906 so that the field would be in shape for baseball season [4] [5] [6].  An interesting, if inconsequential, note, is that there was a contest to name the as-yet nameless field around the same time as the work pasued; it's not clear which name won, if any, as the results were never published and the field never re-named [7].</p>

<p>The field was used until a large donation was made by alumnus Dr. Isaac Emerson for the construction of a new field on the same location as Campus Field II.  The construction of Emerson Field took long enough that the season's games were played on Class Field, a smaller field which had previously been used for scrimmages or intracollegiate competition [8].</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not yet found a digitized period map showing the field.  Instead, the placement has been primarily aided by the research of James L. Gilbert, a UNC football history enthusiast. See his work <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesleegilbert/52209594061/in/album-72157714440739991/">here</a>.</p>
