	<h2>Arizona Stadium - Tucson, AZ</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Arizona Stadium</b> has been used by Arizona from 1929 to present; it replaced a small, on-campus playing field known variously as University Grounds, Arizona Field, or UA Field which was in use from 1901 to 1928 [1].  It also hosted the Copper Bowl (later, among other names, the Cactus Bowl; now the Guaranteed Rate Bowl) from 1989-1999.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 0-1 at this field.  Though the lone game played is officially considered a neutral site game, the Wolfpack faced the Arizona Wildcats as part of the Copper Bowl in their true home venue.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Arizona Stadium opened in October 1929 with a capacity of 7,000, with bleachers bounding only the western side of the field.  The capacity was increased to 10,000 in 1938 when seats were added to the eastern side of the stands, and to 14,000 in 1947 when the end zones each received bleachers.  Just 3 years later, the stadium was made into a horseshoe configuration, adding 8,700 seats.  In 1965, the western side of the stadium received an additional row of seats, as well as a press box, bringing the total capacity to 40,000.  Once the eastern stands were made to be two-tiered as well, in 1976, the capacity reached 57,000.  Since then, the stadium seating has modulated slightly over the years, down to a present capacity of 50,782.  Major renovations include the removal of a track bounding the field (in 1981), the addition of permanent seating to the North endzone, completing the horseshoe shape (in 1988), and the addition of the Lowell-Stevens Football Facility (in 2013) [2].</p>
