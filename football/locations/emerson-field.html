<p>&emsp;&emsp;<i><a href="../index.html">Return to the main page</a></i></p>

<p>Originally opened as the "New" <b>Campus Athletic Field</b>, this venue (which is refered to in modern writing as <b>Campus Athletic Field II</b>)  was an on-campus playing field used by the University of North Carolina from 1900 through 1914 and again from 1916 through 1926 as <b>Emerson Field</b>; it replaced <a href="old-campus-athletic-field.html">"Old" Campus Athletic Field</a> (aka Campus Athletic Field I).  Class Field temporarily replaced Campus Athletic Field II for the 1915 season while the land used to build Emerson Field, which remained UNC football's home stadium until its replacement by Kenan Stadium in 1927.  The field remained in use for baseball through 1965; in 1967, the field was razed to make way for Davis Library.</p>

<p>NC State played 3 games at Emerson Field, going 0-2-1 while playing every game as a road team.  Two games were canceled, both due to eligibility disputes.  The match in 1900 was canceled over UNC's refusal to abide by <a href="../conferences/North-Carolina-Athletics-Association.html">North Carolina Athletics Association</a> rules, while the 1906 game was canceled after Chapel Hill protested the eligibility of one of NC State's players, following a similar protest by Georgia.  Overall, NC State was outscored 6-45 on this field.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>
<br>

<p>Work began on the new Campus Athletic Field in September 1899, with land "being cleared and leveled on the south-eastern part of the campus" [1].  Construction went slow enough, however, that it was not ready in time for baseball season in January, but was ready by the start of the 1900 football season [2] [3].  In 1905, it was announced that funds had been secured to enlarge the field, and while some work was done, it progressed at a slower pace than expected due to an apparent difficulty in contracting workers.  This caused a stoppage in work starting late January 1906 so that the field would be in shape for baseball season [4] [5] [6].  An interesting, if inconsequential, note, is that there was a contest to name the as-yet nameless field around the same time as the work pasued; it's not clear which name won, if any, as the results were never published and the field never re-named [7].</p>

<p>The field was used until a large donation was made by alumnus Dr. Isaac Emerson for the construction of a new field on the same location as Campus Field II.  The construction of Emerson Field took long enough that the season's games were played on Class Field, a smaller field which had previously been used for scrimmages or intracollegiate competition [8].  By 1916, the field reopened as Emerson Field, with a large section of bleachers bounding one side of the field.  Emerson Field was used by the football team through 1926, and by the baseball team for another 4 decades, but was eventually removed to make way for Davis Library.	</p>

	<figcaption>A picture purporting to show Campus Field II during the 1913 UNC-Wake Forest game.  Though UNC and Wake played twice in 1913 (once in Chapel Hill and once in Durham), the reverse of another copy of this picture in Folder 0133 notes that this was during the halftime of the game at Chapel Hill.  Note, however, the lack of any sideline fencing, as seen in the first 1910 picture.  Perhaps they were temporary in nature? You may be able to see the small bleachers shown in the first image towards the left side of the image, however, it is hard to tell for certain [12] [13]</figcaption>
