<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Boston College's old Alumni Field, which sat between 16,000 and 22,000, was spurned by Boston College's football team for nearly a decade before seeing one maiden usage in 1955.  The reason for this shift was two-fold: first and foremost, the football stands were in rough shape.  While not quite condemned from a legal standpoint, in 1946 "college authorities [had] been advised by the insurance company that it would be wise to keep the stands empty until extensive repairs have been made."  Such repairs were a near impossibility due to the post-war boom in house construction, which received priority when procuring wood.  The other reason was the Eagles' success: "since Boston College has been having good football teams, the intown parks have been utilized instead of the Heights."  Because both of these problems impacted football more than the other sports (the baseball stands were reportedly in fine shape), Alumni Field still saw use as a venue for baseball and track &amp; field. [4].</p>

<p>Things began changing, however, in the spring of 1957.  A group of alumnis known as the "Bald Eagles" got together to get the school an on-campus stadium worthy of playing on, with the hope that "the move back to campus athletics and away from the ball park [<a href="nickerson-field.html">Braves Field</a> and Fenway park] will go far toward making a game with Boston College more attractive to teams of the highest caliber," thus solving the same scheduling issues that plagued many of the nation's prominent Catholic teams, most notably Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Alumni Stadium opened in 1957 with 27,000 seats; with the help of alumni John F. Kennedy, the inaugural game was a matchup against the US Naval Academy [1].  The $250,000 (about $2.7 million in 2023) stadium was partially built using the relocated and repaired stands from Alumni Field; this time, the stadium was built with future expansion in mind [5] [6].  The stadium was built on the land of a former reservoir, which was gradually filled over time.  Evidence of this can be seen in the 1957 aerial view of Alumni Stadium below [8].</p>

<p>Expansion occurred in 1971, when the stadium's capacity was expanded to 32,000 by the addition of seats to the stadium's west side; other work done at the time was the addition of a field house, the installation of artificial turf, and the construction of permanent lights for night football games [7].  In 1988, the stadium was renovated again; the end zone seats (which were "rickety and in bad repair") were removed and the stadium's east side deck made to match the previous expansion.  The stadium's capacity remained at 32,000 -- the University's seating permit was already at its maximum, and was not increased as part of the work [9].  A new press box was also added as a part of the renovation.</p>

<p>In 1994, BC initiated plans to expand the stadium by 12,500 seats, bringing the venue's total to 44,500.  The work consisted of adding new grandstands and upper decks to both endzones [10].  The stadium's track was also removed [2].</p>
