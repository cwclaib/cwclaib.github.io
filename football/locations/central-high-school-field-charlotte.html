<p>Charlotte's Central High School opened in 1923, and had played their home games largely at Charlotte's Wearn Field.  This all began to change in late 1928, when it was announced that the school would have an athletic field of its own.  Construction was initially expected to start in late June, but was delayed while a bluff which obscured traffic was removed.  Around the same time, the city considered an extension of 5th Street; such an extension would have forced the new athletic field and baseball diamond to be moved elsewhere.  Eventually, a compromise was reached, and work was started in earnest by late July.  Work was completed in March at a cost of $24,980.20 (a bit under $450,000 in 2023) [1].</p>

<p>  The field's construction wrought the site from "a marshy waste land [sic]... and general eyesore" to a field "almost any college would be proud of."  The field held its first action on Friday, September 27th, 1929: the Central High Wildcats defeated the Salisbury Yellow Jackets 32-7.  The field hosted its first collegiate action the next day, pitting Davidson against Clemson.  The Tigers won 32-14 during a game where 8,000 spectators crowded around the field -- pre-game reports claimed the new bleachers could seat between 5,500 and 6,000 [2] [3].</p>

<p>In 1932, a storm drain servicing the adjacent Armory building, which went under the athletic field, was replaced with a larger one after the building flooded due to a rapid onslaught of rain.  This issue first emerged just after the field's completion in 1929, the same year the armory building was erected.  Made on a notoriously short timeframe to host a Confederate Veterans' reunion, the Armory's builders were likely to blame, but the city council attempted to get the school board to foot the bill on the work; the board was understandably reticent to tear up their brand-new field for a problem they didn't strictly cause*.  As a result, construction was delayed for several years, but eventually took place over the summer of 1932 [4]<!-- [Z].--></p>

<p>By 1937, the high school had moved its home football games to <a href="american-legion-memorial-stadium.html">American Legion Stadium</a>.  Starting around that time, the grounds were used almost solely for track events, though prep school and scrimmage games continued to take place until the 1940s.  For the remainder of its life, the stadium's primary gridiron action was as a practice field for one of the two <a href="../../writing/shrine-bowl-carolinas.html">Shrine Bowl</a> squads.  The bleachers seem to have gone missing at some point, but I could find no report of when this happened.  By the 1950s, the field was formally a practice field, and when the school closed in 1959, it went unused.  It was converted into a parking lot around 1961; the work was definitely done by 1964, but an exact date has not been found [5].</p>

<p>* The argument could be made that the storm system was designed with the intent of draining into the formerly marshy site which, when converted into a football field, did not absorb water as well.  Given that the stadium was directly next to the Little Sugar Creek, this argument seems weak.</p>
