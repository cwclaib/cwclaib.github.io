<body>
<p>Columbia's <b>Fair Grounds</b> were used primarily by South Carolina and Clemson for their long-standing "Big Thursday" rivalry game, played on the Thursday of fair week; once the rivalry was pasued from 1902-1909, the teams took to hosting neutral site contests on the grounds.  It was replaced by <a href="fair-grounds-columbia-ii.html">Fair Grounds II</a> for fair purposes, though it remained supplemented by the Gamecock's on-campus <a href="davis-field.html">Davis Field</a> for its lifespan.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Though regional fairs were long popular throughout the state, South Carolina was one of the nation's early adoptors of the state fair model, organizing the first statewide fair on the grounds of the statehouse grounds from 1840 to 1845, failing chiefly due to the era's lack of transportation.  After nearly a decade on ice, the State Agricultural Society was revived in 1856, bringing the fair back to the state capital.  But this time, the fair would not be held at the capitol building: the City of Columbia provided a 30-acre plot of land in the north section of the city, just off of Elmwood Avenue, with the first fair held in November 1856 [1].</p>

<p>The fair ran from 1856 to 1861, when the outbreak of the Civil War necessitated a second pause in the event.  Having been used as a laboratory by the Confederacy, all of the fair's permanent structures were burnt in 1865 during Sherman's March to the Sea; that, plus the general condition of the post-war south, delayed the fair's reopening until 1869, when the city re-leased the land to the state agricultural society.  The first fair featured a two-story, 80' x 40' exhibit building, as well as a 1/2-mile racetrack with a grandstand.  In 1871, the grounds hosted their first match of baseball, and by 1873, the race track was enlarged to be 3/4-mile.  At the same time, a new grandstand seating about 1,500 persons was erected [1] [2].</p>

<p>The fair proved to be a success, with the midway being relocated to Main Street starting the 1880's to provide room for other festivities.  In addition to industrial, agricultural, and crafting skills, these events included sports.  The first football game was held on the fairgrounds on November 14th, 1891, when Trinity (now Duke) defeated Furman by an astounding 96-0 score; the space had also previously been used for horse racing and baseball.  I have been unable to find descriptions of any major renovations or enlargements to the Fair Grounds' grandstand or bleachers, though some bleachers were constructed.</p>

<p>The fair remained at the Elmwood location until 1903, when a privately-owned portion of the racetrack (owned by Charles Logan) was sold for residential lots.  This was just as well, since the grounds had long-since outgrown the tract, the midway having been relocated to downtown since the 1880s.  When the new grounds were selected, most of the old buildings were demolished -- one of the few surviving structures was the grandstand, which was transferred from the Elmwood grounds to the new location, at Rosewood Avenue [1] [3].</p>

<p>That marks the end of the fair at the Elmwood Avenue site, but not the end of its athletic uses.  The 1904 baseball season was played at the old fairgrounds before the grandstand was relocated.  The following season, the site was again selected after the University of South Carolina declined the use of their grounds (Davis Field), with the semi-pro baseball team (the Columbia Skyscrapers, of the South Atlantic League) agreeing to keep up the grounds until Logan's wife passed away and the land would legally be deeded to the city to become a school.  They built a 1,000-seat grandstand in the southwest corner of the grounds, facing almost due north [4].</p>

<p>The diamond remained at the corner of Elmwood and Gadsden through 1912, though the condition of the grounds was never considered ideal.  Improvements were fairly minimal thanks to the looming threat of expulsion; by 1907, it was expected the baseball nine would relocate to the new fair grounds.  Nonetheless, South Carolina's Sally League entrants, the Comers, forged on, adding about 1,000 bleacher seats (200 of them for colored patrons) in 1908 and putting the grounds through an "almost complete transformation" in 1909.  A minor (but fun) addition came in 1910, when Columbia's park became among the nation's first to have a "Hit This" sign -- theirs was a common Bull Durham tobacco-sponsored bull offering sharpshooting batters $50 (just under $1,700 today) for connecting ball to bovine [5].</p>

<p>Despite further bandying for "a firm and permanent" location, the Comers never did quite come or go, finishing out the 1912 South Atlantic League season in Elmwood.  In early 1913, though, the town finally received the title, as well as Charles' promised $40,000 (just shy of $1 million in 2025) donation to help establish a new school.  Ground broke in January, and by December 1913, the Logan School opened for classes.  This put the semi-pro team at a loss of where to play: South Carolina still wouldn't volunteer their field for use, and the new Fair Grounds were considered too hard to access [6].</p>

<p>Semi-pro baseball returned in 1914 at a short-lived diamond variously called either League Park or Comer Park, at the southwest corner of Hampton and Huger Streets.  By 1916, the Comers began using Davis Field after Comer Park was demolished to make room for an adjacent business; they remained on the Gamecock's turf until 1927, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_City_Stadium">Capital City Park</a> (formerly Dreyfuss Field) was erected [7].</p>
