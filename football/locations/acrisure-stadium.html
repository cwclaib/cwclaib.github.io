<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>This stadium first opened as <b>Heinz Field</b> in 2001 after a 2-year construction process.  The field, which has always had natural grass, hosted its first football game on August 25th, 2001, a pre-season exhibition game between the Steelers and the Detroit Lions, which the Steelers won 20-7.  After another Steelers exhibition game on August 30th, the Pitt Panthers played their first game in the new venue on September 1st, defeating East Tennessee 31-0, and lost the following week to South Florida.  All of these games were preceeded by an 'N Sync concert, which opened the venue on August 18th, 2001.</p>

<p>Despite all these events having taken place, the stadium's grand opening was not scheduled to take place until September 16th, when the Steelers hosted their first regular-season game against the Cleveland Browns.  Due to the 9/11 Terror Attacks, both the grand opening and a UAB-Pitt football game were postponed; the Steelers did not formally christen the stadium until October 7th [1] [2].</p>

<p>The stadium opened with an initial capacity of 64,450 people, and that number has not changed greatly since.  There have been minor modifications in 2006, 2010, and 2014, which seem to have primarily expanded seating in club and premier seating areas.  The first modification grew the maximum attendance by just 600 seats, while the second increased seating by just 450.  The most major renovation was the 2015 expansion, which added 2,900 seats, new video boards, and field-level suites, bringing the venue to its current capacity of 68,400 [3] [4].</p>
