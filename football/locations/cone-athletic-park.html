	<h2>Cone Athletic Park - Greensboro, NC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Cone Athletic Park I</b> was a neutral site venue used by area teams from 1902-1906, replacing the use of <a href="athletic-park-greensboro.html">Athletic Park</a> and the <a href="central-carolina-fair-grounds.html">Central Carolina Fair Grounds</a> as the area's primary college football and baseball venue.  <b>Cone Park II</b> opened in 1906 located just a couple blocks to the north, and was used by minor league baseball teams in Greensboro until its demolition in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 0-1 at this field, with its only game a neutral-site non-conference loss.  There was one canceled game which was likely intended to be played against Guilford College at this location in 1903, however, due to lack of details it is not known for certain which park the game was intended to take place in.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>In March 1902, athletics enthusiasts from around North Carolina gathered in Raleigh to form a new baseball league, the North Carolina League.  The North Carolina League was not technically new, though: it was a continuation of the 1901 Virginia-North Carolina Baseball League.  The V-NC League, which played from April to August 1901, was initially home to six teams, with Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Richmond representing Virginia, and Raleigh and Wilmington showing out for North Carolina [1].</p>

<!-- <p>By late June, however, several of the Virginia teams folded due to a lack of local support and difficulties receiving funding, apparently due to the poor showing of Richmond's team (the logic being that gate receipts from trips to Richmond had been expected to help defray their expenses, but the Richmond team's poor playing resulted in low gate receipts [7]).  With two teams having disbanded, the league voted to relocate Portsmouth's team to Charlotte, and Newport News's team to Tarboro, retaining the six team league and leaving Norfolk and Richmond as the two Virginia teams.  Further, it was chosen to split the season into two halves, with the first half runnning from opening day to June 22nd, and the second running from then until September 2nd [2] [3].</p>

<p>The league went on for another month before Richmond's lackluster playing resulted in another ugly issue: after one inning of the Charlotte-Richmond game, rain began falling over Virginia's River City.  The Richmond players staged a sort of mutiny, dividing the $350 (about $12,500 today) in gate receipts and disbanding.  Though there was talk of moving the Richmond team to Durham and the Norfolk team (which disbanded after Richmond's mutiny to avoid being the sole Old Dominion team) to Statesville, those talks never came to fruition [4] [5] [6].</p>

<p>Charlotte, Raleigh, Wilmington, and Tarboro nearly finished the season, playing until mid-August when Charlotte's teams, living up to their Hornet monicker, bristled over the continued inclusion of one umpire, Paul Russell, and tendered their resignation.  Prospects of fielding a three-team league were not enticing, so the remaining trio voted on whether to close the season immediately; Raleigh and Wilmington voted to, while Tarboro fought to continue the season.</p>

<p>Ironically, Tarboro was the only team who did not get to play afterwards, with Raleigh and Wilmington agreeing to play five games -- 2 in the former city and 3 in the latter -- before a six-match barnstorming run throughout eastern North Carolina, playing at whichever cities bid the most to determine the state champion (Tarboro's team was not considered because of their worse record) [8] [9].  The order of games was later changed to be first five games in Raleigh, followed by a game in a neutral city (later selected to be New Bern) and the remainder of the games needed to reach six victories in Wilmington.  Due to a series of rain delays, as well as mounting bills and tempers, the series was never finished. After three games, Wilmington protested the result of a game Raleigh claimed to win on August 21st.  Per league rules, the teams attempted to replay the protested game the following day, but on account of rain, the game was canceled. Raleigh attempted to cancel the New Bern game and have the remaining games played off as a double header on August 26th, but Wilmington refused, citing a lack of gate receipts (Raleigh, for their part, blamed the poor weather for this).  The season ended without resolution [10].</p>
-->
<p>The second time around proved little better.  The new North Carolina league included Raleigh, Charlotte, and Wilmington, but added Greensboro, Durham, and New Bern; the league was spearheaded by Raleigh, who began a push for a league of at least six (but preferably eight) teams in January 1902 [11] [12].  The first half of the season went well, but shortly after their mid-season break, things went awry.  Wilmington, who had been playing poor ball all season (and consequently losing money) folded their team on July 5th [13] [14].  The league had intentions for the so-called Orphans to play on while the league searched for a new host city, but the members had already been payed off and had no obligation to remain [15].  Wilmington's withdrawal and the evident difficulty in finding a second team precipitated in Charlotte's departure from the league, this time peaceably rather than acrimoniously.  Charlotte chose to remove itself due to its distance from the other clubs [16].</p>

<p>The final days of the league were a hectic mess, with rumors of teams being kicked out mixing with a request that members of the defunct teams report to Raleigh immediately* or risk being banned forevermore from league events.  Simultaneously, news was swirling that the few remaining teams were jettisoning their best players to other leagues in a desperate effort to remain solvent [17] [18].  In the fray, Durham rescinded their team, and in the end, Raleigh, Greensboro, and New Bern all agreed not to persue a championship pennant [19].</p>

<p>Out of all the chaos, though, Greensboro got her first true ballpark.  A team association was organized in March 1902, and upon its organization, Caesar Cone, a wealthy industrialist who had opened several mills in the city, agreed to donate some of his land towards that end [20].  Work began quickly, and the park, replete with grandstands and a fence, opened by late April [21] [22].  By June, the grandstands' capacity was doubled, though to what number it did not say; estimates for capacity baseball games the following years hovered around 1,200 [23] [24].  In 1904, the field hosted one of the earliest night baseball games in the state, pitting Guilford College against Olson's Cherokee Indians<!--https://www.hakes.com/Image/MediumRes/3747/1/image.jpg-->, a barnstorming team from Watervliet, Michigan; light was furnished by a traveling Pullman railcar, which was also outfitted with a portable grandstand capable of seating 1,000 spectators; a score has not been found [25].</p>

<p>In 1905, a second iteration of the Virginia-North Carolina League was organized, this time with a team in Greensboro; the league again folded before the completion of the season.  Despite the fact the city had no prospects of fielding a professional team for the coming season, the grounds for Cone Park were moved a couple hundred yards (the distance was noted to be as little as "a short distance" and as much as 500 yards) northward**, at the cost of about $1,000 (about $33,400 today).  As part of the move, the field orientation was also rotated so that the sun impacted fielders' vision less [26].  This second venue is referred to as Cone Athletic Park II.</p>

<p>"So far as grounds are concerned," said future mayor and local baseball enthusiast Leon Brandt, "we can have a better park than we have ever had, and only about one hundred yards north of the Cone Athletic Park where we have had so many fine games. The [ground] is level, and without much cost we could make a ball park that would be an inducement to bring other clubs here."  He went on to predict that, should work start by late February, it could be completed prior to April, start of the regular ball season [27].  Work began on March 12th, and was completed a few weeks later; NC State and Guilford christened the new park on April 6th -- NC State won 26-3 before a crowd of 500 [28] [29].</p>

<p>Because NC State did not play at Cone Athletic Park II, I will not be detailing its history as closely.  Brandt's prediction rang true, however, and by 1908 Greensboro had a baseball team: the Greensboro Champs -- later renamed the Patriots.  Other than one season in 1917, when the league was suspended due to World War I, the Patriots remained in Greensboro, playing at Cone Field II through 1929, when they moved to World War Memorial Stadium [30].</p>

<p>* The likely reason "orphan" players were asked to go to Raleigh was so that the remaining teams could auction them off to other leagues, or rebuild their own skeleton team with those players.</p>

<p>** The park probably moved roughly from the location shown in the map below, near the interesection of Summit and Bessemer, to a location closer to the intersection of Summit and Wendover -- see a visual <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesleegilbert/52766822449/in/album-72157714440739991/">here</a>.  We know for a fact that the first iteration of Cone Park wasn't on the northeast corner of Summit and Bessmer, as that lot was bought in 1903 (<a href="https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn85042104/1903-04-23/ed-1/seq-1/#words=Avenue+Railway+Summit">link</a>).  Similarly, we can rule out the southwest corner, the location of <a href="https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101459598-img">St. Leo's Hospital</a>, which began construction in 1904 (<a href="https://gateway.uncg.edu/islandora/object/ghm:15492#page/6/mode/1up">link</a>).  That leaves the northwest corner and the southeast corner; it is possible the field was on the northwest corner, however that was the land which the Caesar Cone Estate (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122718464/caesar-cone-estate/">link</a>), and it seems unlikely he would want the ballpark directly on his land.  That leaves the southeast corner as the most likely location, however this cannot be fully confirmed.</p>

<h2>Pictures of Cone Athletic Park</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the pictures below can be completely confirmed to be of the original Cone Athletic Park, as it was laid out from 1902-1906.  Additionally, no photos of the grounds being used as a football field were found.  However, since the same structure was used at both locations, pictures of the fields are likely to be rather similar aside from any trees or buildings in the background.</p>

	<figcaption>View of Bennett College's baseball team, probably at Cone Athletic Park.  The original caption identifies the team as circa 1880-1890, however it appears to me to be later than that, probably 1900-1910.  Images from my source and that of the <a href="https://lib.digitalnc.org/record/29601?ln=en#?xywh=122%2C1651%2C2496%2C1060&cv=138"><i>Bennett Belle</i> (1973)</a> insinuate that the coach on the right (in the suit and hat) may be James D. Corrothers, who was at Bennett College about 1893-1894; that would obviously mean the picture is not of Cone Athletic Park.  On the other hand, I found no evidence of Bennett playing intercollegiate baseball until 1904 <!-- https://sortedbyname.com/letter_c/c223149.html https://www.newspapers.com/image/349468161/?terms=%22D.%20corrothers%22%20greensboro&match=1 https://www.newspapers.com/image/228105369/?terms=%22james%20corrothers%22%20greensboro&match=1 --> [32]</figcaption>
