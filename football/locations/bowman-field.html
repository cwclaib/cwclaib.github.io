	<h2>Bowman Field - Calhoun/Clemson, SC</h2>
</center>

<body>
<p><b>Bowman Field</b> was used by Clemson's football team from 1898-1914; it was their first home field (the Tigers played only road or neutral site games in 1896 and 1897) and was replaced by Riggs Field.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 0-1 at this field.  Aditionally, NC State canceled one game against Clemson here, probably due to a lack of suitable players.</p>

<p>Though Bowman Field was a part of collegiate life at Clemson from the university's founding in 1889, an athletic event was not held on the field until April 24th, 1896, when Clemson and Furman crossed bats; Clemson went on to lose 13-20.  The field is named for Randolph T. V. Bowman, an early instructor at Clemson's forge.  In addition to his work for the athletic teams, Bowman also coached the early baseball teams and assisted in coaching football.  He was also instrumental in clearing the land so it could be suitable as a baseball diamond.  The field was originally just referred to as the drill and athletic field, but was renamed in 1899 after his passing [1] [2].</p>

<p>Starting in the spring of 1906, a semi-itenerant track was constructed "on the lower end of Bowman Field," but it did not seem to ever be a permanent fixture and was either destroyed or fell into disrepair until it was gotten into shape the next Spring [3].  Beyond this, I can find no evidence of improvements to the field.  No evidence of permanent stands has been found.</p>
