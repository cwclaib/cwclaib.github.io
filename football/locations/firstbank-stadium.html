<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>Concern had long existed among Vanderbilt athletics that their on-campus Dudley Field I, which opened in 1892, was too small, and was at risk of encroachment by college buildings.  In fact, the school took methods to resolve this as early as 1906, when an 11-acre lot was purchased between 25th and 27th Avenues to the east and west, and West End and Highland Avenues to the north and south.  Despite early plans to transition college athletics to those grounds, the move was delayed for reasons that remain somewhat unclear [1].</p>

<p>The property remained in the hands of Vanderbilt's Athletic Association when, in late 1921, moves towards providing the Commodores with an improved home field found a new stride.  Through an aggressive fundraising campaign, the school was able to raise over $150,000 (over $2.7 million in 2025) in capital through a combination of public and private funding for the project.  Work began in mid-February with plans to finish by September 15th, though construction delays forced the Commodores to play their first two games at old Curry Field [2].</p>

<p>Despite being a stadium by every quantifiable metric, Vanderbilt officials elected to retain the name Dudley Field, noting the "less pretentious and more modest" nature of the moniker.  The new structure, encircled by a track, opened with 20,000 seats in a horseshoe shape open at the north; that end held the Walter O. Parmer Field House, a brick structure named for a Nashville businessman and philanthropist.  The first structure in the south built solely for football, the venue was dedicated on October 14th, 1922 in a scoreless agame against Michigan to a crowd of sixteen thousand [3].</p>
<!-- https://vucommodores.com/vanderbilt-s-historic-parmer-field-house/ -->

<p>The Gold and Black held off on major improvements to the stadium for a while, instead constructing additional practice fields on the land surrounding new Dudley Field, with work on the future McGugin Field coming in 1924, and additional practice fields following in 1929-1931; this era also marked the revision of Dudley Field's running track, since the old one was not a regulation quarter mile track.  And after being teased for nearly a decade, a new press box finally came in the midst of the 1938 season, replacing the open-air, single story unit with a two story, glass-enclosed unit. A public address (PA) system and new scoreboard were also installed [4].</p>

<p>Though temporary stands had been added to the north side of the stadium as early as 1930, permanent enlargements were delayed until 1949, when 5,500 steel seats were added to the west side of the stadium -- the new addition was modeled after the brand-new Ladd-Peebles Stadium.   At the same time an expansion of the east side was considered, but ultimately delayed until a later date.  Because the existing press box would have blocked the view of some of these seats, it was demolished and substituted by an out-of-the-way triple-decker affair.  In 1954, the stadium was equipped with permanent lighting, with $20,000 (just over $240,000 in 2025) towards the project donated by an organization associated with the Billy Graham Crusade, noting that the price was less than the rental of temporary lights and the venue rental fees which Vanderbilt had waived.  The lights were built on towers outside of the field so as not to block the view, and augmented with additional lights in 1957, 1963, and 1967 [5].</p>

<p>In 1958, a new electric scoreboard was installed, and in 1960, the eastern field was finally developed; the 6,300 new seats put capacity up to 34,000 total capacity. The school installed an AstroTurf field in 1970; at the same time, the old cinder track which encircled the field was removed with plans to construct a dedicated plant, though actual work was delayed after legal challenges forced a hold on work; the men's track program was put on hold in 1973, never to be revived, though a meager complex was built in 1980.  In the same 1970 offseason, a new scoreboard was installed once again, with another installed in 1979 [6].</p>

<p>While the scoreboard was replaced often, hold were continued expansions to the stadium, with the Nashville team facing pressure from their Southeastern Conference counterparts to increase attendance, with some teams' venues nearly doubling the capacity of the Commodores' plant.  In preparation for more major work to be ready by the following season, 2,000 seats were added to the north endzone, supplementing the few thousand wooden seats which had become fairly permanent since the 1950s.  The phase of work drew some mockery from local fans after a portion of the western steel bleachers where the future press box would go were left unimproved and a new artificial turf was installed that did not quite reach the edges of the stadium.</p>

<p>Then, in November 1980, construction started on a revised bowl.  The old concrete bleachers were torn away while the steel structures on each side of the field were raised several feet into the air and prepped to receive a new lower bowl.  Work was completed on schedule, with the new stadium hosting a full complement of 41,000 spectators for the Commodores' second home game of the season versus Alabama.  The new plant was renamed <b>Vanderbilt Stadium</b> (though the playing surface continued to honor Dudley), while the press box was named in honor of Fred Russell, a retired newspaperman who raised $250,000 (just under $900,000 in 2025) for the new writers' coop.  New lighting was installed before the 1983 season to help with lighting during night broadcasts [7].</p>

<p>In 1998, the stadium received a new tenant, as well as a new jumbotron north endzone.  The new tenant was the Oilers (now the Titans), who spent a single season on the collegiate grid while <a href="nissan-stadium.html">Nissan Stadium</a> remained under construction.  Commenting on the timing of the construction, Vanderbilt athletics director Todd Turner explained that "We're doing some things to make the stadium look good, but we were probably were going to do that anyway."  The following season, the synthetic turf was removed in favor of natural grass for the first time in three decades.  And after the 2002 season, the north endzone bleachers were removed and replaced with concessions, dropping capacity to 39,773 persons [8].</p>

<p>In 2012, a series of largely aesthetic renovations took place, converting the grounds back to synthetic turf, replacing the video board oncemore, and installing a roughly 450-seat, first-come, first-served grass berm in the north endzone; this work pushed capacity to 40,350 persons.  In 2014, new lights were installed.  Once again, though, Vanderbilt's stadium was seen as lackluster when compared to its SEC peers; college leaders even considering opening an off-campus stadium to remedy the situation.  Instead, a new revitalization program was launched, with the stadium being christened <b>FirstBank Stadium</b>.  After a season of reduced capacity (28,500) in 2023 due to construction in both endzones, a portion of the premium north endzone seating (mostly a bar-style lounge) opened in 2024, giving the venue 28,934 seats.  In 2025, completed premium seating at both endzones gave the plant a revamped capacity of 35,000 seats.  Further expansion is likely to be limited due to the tight nature of the stadium's on-campus layout [9].</p>

EXCLUSIVE: Vanderbilt in talks for new football stadium
Adam Sparksasparks@tennessean.com
Updated Sept. 16, 2016, 12:08 p.m. CT

Vanderbilt Stadium is empty for the weather delay late in the first half of the game between Vanderbilt and MTSU on Sept. 10, 2016. Vanderbilt is the only SEC school that has not overhauled its football stadium in the past 15 years.
The time for a new Vanderbilt football stadium may have arrived.

Athletic director David Williams wants to accelerate plans to construct a new stadium for the Commodores, and is meeting with university planners and financial officers later this month.

“Even before I took over (as AD in 2003), people were saying, ‘Stadium, stadium, stadium’ because everybody was building stadiums,” Williams said. “But there hadn’t been serious talk internally about it before this.

“When you look at SEC stadiums, we are not in the same ballpark as the rest of them. That’s not a secret.”

The other 13 SEC schools have overhauled their football stadiums in the past 15 years, with those projects costing more than $1.2 billion combined. The last major renovation to Vanderbilt Stadium was in 1981. Less expensive additions for new turf and a video board have glossed its appearance in recent years.

Williams said plans for a new stadium, or at least a major renovation, are only in the preliminary stages, but the project is now a top priority in the athletic department.

Looking at same location
Williams said an off-campus plan will be considered, but that’s an unlikely scenario.

“Off campus? You never say never, so we’ll look at it,” Williams said. “But there are sports that seem to play on campus better, and football is one of those.”

Building a stadium at the site of the current facility is most likely, Williams said. He doesn't want another renovation.

Vanderbilt Stadium has undergone multiple renovations since its initial construction in 1922. The 1981 massive face-lift was akin to building a new facility, but the current stadium is still a patchwork of the past century.

And there's little room for expansion. The Nashville Marriott hotel is to the north. Hawkins Field baseball stadium is immediately to the east. Jess Neely Drive is to the south. And Natchez Trace is to the west.

Williams would like to find a few more feet somewhere in the existing space to expand the narrow concourse, what he considers a weakness of the current stadium.

“You need to make a bigger footprint where the stadium is now, but you would probably have to impede on (Natchez Trace) or the sidewalk. I don’t know if we could do that or not,” Williams said. “We are pretty landlocked, at least if you’re talking about building something of that magnitude. But there are no other places on campus to build.”

Could come sooner than later
Williams said he wants to build a new stadium in the next three or four years, but that depends on the speed of fundraising. Preliminary discussions started with Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos, and earlier this week Williams was slated to meet with Eric Kopstain, vice chancellor for administration, and Brett Sweet, vice chancellor for finance, to narrow the plan. However, that meeting was postponed until the last week of September due to scheduling conflicts.

“What can we do? How do we pay for it? That’s what they will be able to tell me,” Williams said. “We will do our due diligence to make sure the final plan is feasible before we take it to (Zeppos and the Board of Trust).”

Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt vice chancellor of public affairs, said neither she nor Zeppos would "have anything to add" to what Williams has said on the stadium initiative. Likewise, coach Derek Mason deferred comment to Williams on stadium matters while he focuses on coaching his team during the season.

There are plenty of contingencies for Williams, Kopstain and Sweet to discuss. Paying a premium price could get the facility built during one offseason, but the likely scenario would require Vanderbilt to play one season at another home field — probably the Titans’ Nissan Stadium. But Vanderbilt is far from that stage right now.

Other recent Vanderbilt athletics projects are done or winding down. A $6.5 million renovation to the McGugin Center athletic training room was completed this spring. The new baseball complex is under construction and scheduled to be finished at the beginning of the 2018 season, and the entire $12 million has been raised to complete it.

“So the (football) stadium is the next project, and it’s time to look at it in a real way,” Williams said. “We will have to go a long way with it because we are talking about a price tag we’ve never dealt with before.”

The bad weather led to a beautiful sky over Vanderbilt Stadium in the second half of the game between Vanderbilt and MTSU on Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016, in Nashville.
Better but not bigger
A new stadium probably would cost between $60 million and $90 million, or perhaps more depending on amenities and several other factors, Williams said. He wants a new stadium to be better but not necessarily bigger.

Vanderbilt Stadium has a capacity of 40,550, and a new facility would have a similar amount of seating. In the previous five seasons (2011-15), the Commodores averaged 34,526 in attendance at home games.

In 2014, Vanderbilt completed a $31 million multipurpose indoor practice facility, funded by a combination of philanthropy and university investment, according to the school’s athletics website.

Williams said a new stadium would be paid through several sources, including donations, ticket revenue, luxury suite sales and perhaps corporate naming rights.

Like with the multipurpose facility, Williams said any pitch to the Board of Trust to build a new stadium would be helped if there were other uses for the facility.

For example, Georgia Tech and Wake Forest house offices in their football stadiums. Florida State’s Doak Campbell Stadium has a restaurant and the university’s school of hospitality academic program. And Ohio State previously had a non-athletic dorm for students within its stadium walls until it was demolished during a 1999 renovation.

“To get the bang for your buck, especially at a private university, you can’t just ask people for a lot of money for a stadium that will be used seven times a year (for home games),” Williams said. “So you’ve got to ask what else can happen at a stadium.”

Possible partners with MLS
Williams is on a 22-member organizing committee trying to land a future Major League Soccer expansion franchise in Nashville. He said “initially soccer folks are looking for a soccer-dedicated stadium,” but Williams is open to a possible partnership in sharing a new stadium if it created additional revenue for Vanderbilt.

Nashville businessman Bill Hagerty, who is leading the push for an MLS expansion franchise in Nashville, said the possibility of playing MLS soccer at a future new Vanderbilt football stadium “has potential.” He characterized talks regarding the concept as preliminary.

“It’s certainly an interesting concept that we would not disregard without giving it full consideration,” said Hagerty, former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development under Republican Gov. Bill Haslam.

“It’s something we would think about,” he added. “Obviously, we want to do it in partnership with the city, with the mayor’s office. It’s not just a unilateral process here. We’ve not eliminated anything at this point.”

A newly constructed stadium, on campus, is preferable, Williams said.

“A new stadium does not need to be tied to me or any one person. But if I happen to be around, I’d love to open that sucker,” Williams said. “But whether I’m here or not, we need a new football stadium. It’s time for it. We need to get it done.”

How Vanderbilt football will play in FirstBank Stadium amid construction in 2023, what fans need to know

Vanderbilt football is playing games at FirstBank Stadium in 2023 despite extensive construction in both end zones. While work continues to get done on the stadium, the Commodores have already hosted five home games and will host a sixth, the homecoming game against Auburn, on Nov. 4.

The stadium is under construction to make improvements to facilities for both football and basketball. Work on the north end zone − which includes a new basketball operations center and premium football seating − began in February, while work on the south end zone, which will contain new locker rooms, a dining hall for athletes and additional premium seating, began in April.

One of the side effects of construction is that the video board was removed in the north end zone. Instead, a temporary video board is in the south end zone, suspended by cables and a crane.

Padding is present in both end zones to prevent injury to players who may run out of the back of the end zone. The padding is similar to the material used for an outfield wall in baseball.

Construction will continue on the stadium Monday through Friday throughout the season. The Friday before each home game, crews will convert the stadium for its gameday setup. The Commodores use the stadium for select practices during the week.

Vanderbilt is hopeful that the portions of the north end zone construction that include additional football seating will be ready for the 2024 season.

The parking setup will be similar to the 2022 season, and tailgating will still be allowed in the surface lots off Natchez Trace. Vanderbilt officials recommend parking in a lot that is on the same side of the stadium as your seats, otherwise a long walk may be necessary.

There are several road closures amid the construction. 25th Avenue is closed between Blakemore and Highland Avenues and Natchez Trace is closed between Jess Neely Drive and West End Avenue. Jess Neely Drive is permanently closed to vehicle traffic as the university plans to convert the street into a pedestrian walkway.

Vanderbilt continues the same locker room setup it had in 2022, utilizing locker rooms in McGugin Center to dress. For in-game meetings, the Commodores are using the baseball team's pitching lab underneath the stands.

The visiting team has a temporary setup located across Natchez Trace from FirstBank Stadium. Located underneath a white tent, the visiting team setup has bathrooms, showers and air conditioning.

Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz told reporters after playing at Vanderbilt that the visitors' setup was "as nice as anybody in the SEC."

Vanderbilt football stadium construction update: What fans need to know for 2024 season

Nashville Tennessean
Aug. 27, 2024, 4:44 p.m. CT

Vanderbilt football is continuing to play its home games at FirstBank Stadium amid a construction project that will take over two years to complete.

Unlike a year ago, though, when a swaying scoreboard held up by cranes made headlines and construction vehicles could be seen in the end zone, much more progress has been made for 2024.

The season kicks off Saturday at home vs Virginia Tech (11 a.m., CT, ESPN).

The north end zone premium seating will be open this season, and the basketball team will begin to utilize the new practice gyms in the north end zone before Christmas, a program spokesperson said.

The south end zone construction won't be complete until 2025, but fans can now see the outlines of what will become new seating, suites and a second video board next season.

Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.
Construction on the north end zone began in February 2023, while the south end zone work began in April of that same year.

Here's what's new in the stadium construction:

How can fans enter FirstBank Stadium in 2024?
This season, there will be additional entrances from a year ago. Whereas last year there was one entrance on the corner of Natchez Trace and Jess Neely Drive, and another entrance via Memorial Gymnasium, this season Gates 1 and 4 will also be open for fans, making four different entrances.

Construction on the North End Zone at FirstBank Stadium on the campus of Vanderbilt University Saturday, Aug. 10, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn.
What will Vanderbilt's FirstBank Stadium capacity be in 2024?
The capacity this season will be 28,934. This is just over 400 more seats than there were in 2023, when the capacity was 28,500.

The additional seating from a year ago is in the form of bar-style club seating in the north end zone. There are tables at field level, as well as three rows of seats on the club level.

Vanderbilt's capacity will be even higher in 2025, as the south end zone construction includes both traditional seating and suites.

Construction on the South Suites at FirstBank Stadium on the campus of Vanderbilt University Saturday, Aug. 10, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. The stadium renovations, which began in 2023, are part of a $300 million initiative to support major facilities on campus and operational enhancements.
Vanderbilt visiting locker rooms no longer in tent
A year ago, Vanderbilt's visiting locker rooms were located underneath an air-conditioned tent. That will no longer be the case, as new visiting team locker rooms have been completed for 2024.

The Commodores will continue to utilize McGugin Center to dress while the home locker rooms are still being completed. However, they will no longer use the baseball team's pitching lab for in-game meetings.
