<body>
<p>Nashville's <b>Nissan Stadium</b> is best known as the home of the NFL's Tennessee Titans since opening in 1999.  It has also been the location of the Music City Bowl, having held every edition of the game except the first, which was at <a href="firstbank-stadium.html">Vanderbilt Stadium</a>.  It also serves as the full-time field for the Tennessee State Tigers.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State has a record of 0-1 at this field, losing the sole matchup against the hometown Commodores in what was technically considered a neutral-site match for the Music City Bowl.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>The Oiler's move from Texas to Tennessee was a slow and laborious one.  The team had played previously in Houston's <a href="astrodome.html">Astrodome</a> but announced a move following the close of the 1995 season primarily citing dissatisfaction with the aging multi-sport venue; that frustration was exacerbated when a pre-season game was canceled because of irregularities in the playing surface.  Owner Bud Adams was so eager to get out of the venue that terminated the contract a year early, moving into Memphis, Tennessee's Liberty Bowl ahead of the 1997 season.  Attendance for the Memphis-based Oilers was so abysmal that Adams moved on a year early once again to Vanderbilt Stadium while construction on the new stadium, right on the bank of the Cumberland River, was completed; construction was slightly delayed by a tornado in April 1998, though it still opened as originally targeted [1].</p>

<p>The appearance in their actual hometown bolstered Oilers attendance still, but 1999 truly ushered in the new era of Tennessee's pro football team, with a new name (the Titans) paired to a new 67,000 seat stadium.  Branded first as <b>Adelphia Coliseum</b> (named for the now-defunct cable company) at a cost of $292 million (about $568 million in 2025), it was partially funded by the state government, in return for allowing local HBCU Tennessee State to hold their home games on the field.  The stadium's first game, a pre-season exhibition against the Falcons, was held on August 27th, while the first NCAA action took place a week later, with the Tigers hosting Alabama State for the John Merritt Classic on a Sunday.  The grounds have had natural sod since opening [2].</p>

<p>Being a relatively modern stadium, updates have been fairly meager in nature.  The new millennium ushered in about 1,500 new seats, mostly in the form of luxury suites, though a smattering of spots were added "along some of the aisles in [the] upper and lower bowls of the stadium"; total capacity was 68,498.  Reported capacity increased by 300 for most of the next season, with a single-digit increase of 6 supplanting the number in December<!-- 68,804 Dec 2001 -->, and a 5-person increase the following Christmas<!-- 68,809 Dec 2002-->.  The 2004 season <!-- 68,932 Dec 2003 -->came with another mystery expansion, though this time the number surged by exactly 123, to 68,932 seats.  The 2005 season likewise saw an increase of 217 persons<!-- 69,149-->.  The stadium's only purported decrease in seating took place before the 2006 season, with the number dropping by 6 seats, to 69,143 seats [3].</p>

<p>The only meaningful change in this time was the 2003 renaming of the field to <b>The Stadium</b> after the previous sponsor's company went off air embroiled in scandals, and was renamed <b>LP Field</b> in 2006 in deference to Louisiana-Pacific Building Products.  The original scoreboards were replaced once ahead of the 2007 season, and again before the 2012 season. Ahead of the 2016 season, the plant was renamed <b>Nissan Stadium</b>.  Few more improvements are likely to occur: in 2023, Nashville approved construction on a new, fully-enclosed, stadium immediately adjacent to the old venue after an independent review found modifications and maintenance to be upward of $1.8 billion -- nearly the projected cost of a new venue.  It is slated to be ready in 2027; once opened, the old venue will be reduced to rubble, and the space turned into a public park [4].</p>
