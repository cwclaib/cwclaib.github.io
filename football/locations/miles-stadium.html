<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>The Gobblers moved from their first formal athletic field following the 1925 football season.  Work on the stadium began in conjunction with War Memorial Hall in the summer of 1925; the hall supplemented the grounds by serving as a locker room.  Like its predecessor, the new stadium was also named for VPI stand-out Clarence "Sally" Miles -- the vote to dedicate the field in his honor was unanimous, with fans and alumnis alike noting that the elevated position of Orange and Maroon athletics was "because of him more than any other man."  Because of the similarity to the previous field, it was sometimes called New Miles Field in its early years [1].</p>

<p>By late September, the "finishing touches" were being put on the stadium.  Because funds were collected on subscription basis and most of the cash going towards the hall, the originally-envisioned 12,000-person stadium was not ready the first year.  Concrete bleachers were installed on only the west side of the field, with the west furnished with temporary wooden bleachers.  The first season the capacity was said to be 7,000 seated spots (6,000 of which were concrete), with room for another 5,000 standing patrons.  The plant was designed by professor of civil engineering, R. H. B. Begg [2].</p>
