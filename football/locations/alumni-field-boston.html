<body>
<p><b>Alumni Field</b> (later, though infrequently, called <b>Boston College Stadium</b>) was used by Boston College from 1915-21, 1923, 1932-41, 1943-45, and one final time for the 1955 season; it was the first on-campus football field used by Boston College and was replaced by <a href="alumni-stadium-boston.html">Alumni Stadium</a> before the 1957 football season after intermittent stints at <a href="nickerson-field.html">Braves Field</a> and Fenway Park.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-0 at this field.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>

<p>This was Boston College's first on-campus stadium, and really their first home athletic venue of any kind -- they played nearly all of their games in prior years on the road.  It opened in 1915 with a capacity of 5,000 seats.  After an intense renovation, the field was re-opened before the 1932 season as Boston College Stadium at Alumni Field.  The "new" Alumni Field had an increased capacity of more than three-to-four times the old venue (capacity was variously reported as 16,000-22,000 seats) and was built primarily with student labor [10].</p>

<p>The stadium remained the home venue of Boston College off and on for about a decade, often in conjunction with other local venues, until it sat dormant from 1945-1954 [1].  The primary reason for Alumni Field's disuse was a combination of damaged stands (and difficulty procuring material for repairs) and the fact that Boston College's success drove demand for the Eagles to play in larger stadiums closer to the city center [9].  After being repaired, it saw some action again in 1955, but was eventually replaced in 1957 by Alumni Stadium a few blocks to the east.</p>

<p>When it was demolished, the seats and bleachers of Alumni Field were repurposed and used at Alumni Stadium [6] [7].  Despite this, the land remained open, if denuded, until 1960, seeing use as a practice field and general event space, later becoming known as "The Dustbowl."  The area of campus remained undeveloped until 2013, with the construction of Stokes Hall [8].</p>
