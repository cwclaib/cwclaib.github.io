<body>
<p><b>Maher Field I</b> opened in 1906 as Roanoke's second Fair Grounds, replacing Roanoke's <a href="athletic-park-roanoke.html">Athletic Park</a>.  It was replaced by <a href="victory-stadium.html">Victory Stadium</a> for football, though it still lives on in a sense as a baseball diamond.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 1-1 in two games, both of which were conference affairs.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>


<p>In late 1905, the Tidewater Railway purchased the grounds of Roanoke's agricultural fair.  Taking the change in stride, the fair association purchased the lands immediately to their south and opened <b>Fair Grounds II</b>, bringing the old grandstand, which sat about 2,500 persons, with them.  A second grandstand, seating about 4,000 persons, was also built.  These, as well as 1,500 bleacher seats (creating a total seated capacity of 8,000 persons), were all placed on the south side of the field, abutting the river, so they could be used for both baseball and horse racing action.  Additional bleachers were added along the first base line in 1909 and 1910, while the box seats were replaced in 1912 and temporary stands were placed inside the race track for the 1914 football season [1].</p>

<p>In 1919, both the grandstands burnt to the ground early in the morning of October 1st right at the start of football season.  Unbelievably, the major college football games (of which NC State's contest against the Virginia Military Institute was the first) were not relocated to a new venue; instead, ownership went through the herculean effort of rebuilding the stands in the interim.  About 3,000 seats were ready in time for the fray, while about 4,500 seats were ready for the Thanksgiving game later that month.  Another 3,000 bleacher seats were added during the 1920 football season.  In 1922, 1,200 bleachers were added to the north side of the field and 500 to the east side of the field, providing accommodations for 10,300 persons [2].</p>
<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/912170156/?match=1&terms=%22old%20grandstand%22 -->

<p>The Fair Grounds were sold in 1922 to David W. Flickwir, a chairperson for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, who flipped the property a year later to the rail company.  N&amp;W President Nicholas D. Maher announced that the grounds had nominally been acquired with rail expansion in mind, but fairs and athletic events hosted at the site would continue without interruption.  Actual intentions were most likely more multifaceted: firstly, the locomotive syndicate could improve the grounds in an effort to host more excursion trains for special athletic events, and secondly, the grounds allowed Norfolk &amp; Western to engender intra-company athletics and bolster employee morale.  N&amp;W purchased the field for about $150,000 (over $2.8 million in 2025) [3].</p>

<p>Immediately after taking charge of the grounds, Norfolk &amp; Western enlarged the field with the extension of the grandstand seating on each end of the grandstand, pushing capacity to about 15,500 persons.  At this time, papers began clamoring for the grounds to be renamed <b>Maher Field</b> (or Stadium) in honor of the rail magnate's magnanimity; though some reporters began using the name as early as November 1923, it was not formally renamed in late October 1924.  A rash of expansion closed out the roaring 20s, with 2,258 seats added behind the northern bleachers in 1928, another 2,500 in 1929<!-- location undetermined-->, and 350 stands in 1930 pushing seating from 18,000 to 20,000 to 20,350 resectively.  The first documented scoreboard was installed in 1928 [4].</p>

<p>Despite a few additional improvements (a new press box added to the north bleachers in 1934, a new scoreboard and public address system in 1936, and a field house in 1939), the field began showing its age.  By the late 1930s, several reporters had taken to calling the venue the "Splinter Bowl" in reference to the worn-out wooden seating around the field.  Athletic authorities at Virginia Tech and VMI began bandying for their long-standing "Military Classic of the South" to be relocated to new digs for the first time since 1905; rumors pointed predominantly towards Lynchburg's new concrete <a href="city-stadium-lynchburg.html">City Stadium</a>.  And after 1932, the grounds became sub-prime for baseball when N&amp;W authorities stopped taking down football bleachers, with hits over the northern bleachers resulting in a home run by rule [5].</p>
<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/913944535/?match=1&terms=%22fairgrounds%22%20%22new%20stadium%22 -->

<p>Starting in 1939, Roanoke agreed to lease the land from Norfolk &amp; Western for three years provided the owners completed a series of improvements, primarily the construction of a fieldhouse and the rehabilitation of the race track.  As part of the improvements, the seats were renumbered, lowering capacity to 19,700.  At the same time, a move was afoot for Roanoke to improve not only the city's absence of a modern athletic venue, but also another source of civic disappointment: Roanoke's lack of an armory.  Like many other cities at the time, the Star City of the South elected to kill two birds with one stone and have the structures cohabitate on a single plot of land, keeping local costs down via WPA assistance.  Roanoke elected to tear down old Maher Field and construct Victory Stadium on the property, which was donated to the city after just a year of rental; preliminary reports indicated the field demolition would begin after the 1940 edition of the VMI-VPI game and be complete in time for the following year's festivity [6] [7].</p>
<!-- https://archive.org/details/roanokestoryofco00writ/page/256/mode/2up?q=%22maher+field%22 -->

<p>Before that could be completed, though, the river made sure its voice was heard.  Though the field had been flooded before -- major incidents were also noted in 1910 and 1932 -- never before had the damage been quite so major as the August 1940 flood, which dealt some premature demolition to the site, knocking down the old exhibition building, as well as sweeping away several bleachers and a few sections of fencing.  While the grounds were recovering (and to keep the field in good condition for the semi-pro Dixie League games hosted by the nascent Roanoke Travelers), temporary stands, seating between 5,000 and 5,500 persons, were built and used through mid-October, when repairs to the main stadium had been completed.  These stands, located just west of the regular athletic field, were also oriented running east-west, and were still inside the original Fair Grounds' racetrack.</p>

<p>Demolition of the old wooden field began in late April 1941 once the deed was formally transferred, destroying the racetrack, grandstand, and eastern bleachers; the northern and western stands were spared initially since they did not interfere with work.  Work lagged as war efforts, funding problems, and a shortage of steel compounded to the point that all collegiate football games were relocated, with Roanoke losing the Military Classic to Lynchburg for a season.  In the interim, the temporary western field, which had also been used <!--for an indeterminate number of years -->as Jefferson High School's practice field, was pressed back into service.  This time, the non-demolished stands of old Maher Field were utilized, providing capacity for somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 persons in a north-south orientation mirroring the coming stadium.  Despite the construction, the city still managed to provide temporary lights [8] [9].</p>
<!-- 8500? https://www.newspapers.com/image/913843447/?match=1 -->

<p>The 1941 season proved what is technically the end of Maher Field's life.  However, Maher Field lives on to this day in the form of a baseball diamond at the west end of the property.  Built on a plot at the western edge of the property, the grounds were not formally a part of the complex until late 1940, when Roanoke acquired the property via eminent domain.  A lighted softball diamond was constructed on the grounds in 1941, and upfitted for the semi-pro Roanoke Red Sox (also called the RoSox) in 1943 at the club's expense.  Both grounds retained the Maher name and utilized the old wooden bleachers remnant from the fair days.  To differentiate this venue, I have dubbed it <b>Maher Field II</b> [10].</p>

<p>Maher Field II was used from then until 1954, when a series of legal battles put the diamond out of commission.  After Red Sox ownership suspended the Star City's baseball league midway through the 1953 season, it was assumed the field would revert to amateur use, but unfortunately, the matter was not that simple.  First, the old stands were condemned for the final time, marking the end of the road for the old "Splinter Bowl" seating.  Then, there was an outstanding lien against the Red Sox; in order to pay off the balance, the lights, sound system, and anything else furnished by the baseball team was liquidated at auction, requiring Roanoke to rehabilitate the field oncemore.  The mostly-bleacherless field remained through 1986, when it was torn down and rebuilt as part of a plan to modernize the complex and rebrand as River's Edge Park.  The new field, which opened in 1989, was oriented with pitcher's facing southwest; the old field faced southeast [11].</p>

	<figcaption>Images showing the last general action at the proper Maher Field in the original grandstand.  The first three images are from a couple automotive events in the summer of 1940, while the remainder all show the field's final college football game, on Thanksgiving 1940 between the Virginia Military Institute and Virginia Tech.  The fourth image shows VPI's cadets in formation on the field, while the photographers who took the picture can probably be seen standing atop the grandstand in the fifth photo; the grandstand is also visible in the sixth image.  The seventh and eigth photos offer good images of the other seating in the stadium [22] [17]</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Football action during the 1941 season, where all games took place at the old practice field. The first image shows the the Dixie League's Roanoke Travelers fumbling the ball during their October 19th loss (14-15) against the Newport News Shipbuilders.  The second image shots the Portsmouth Cubs' Larry Weldon running the ball during the Travelers' October 26th loss (2-7), while the third shows Jefferson High defeating Andrew Lewis on the day prior.  The fourth shows Greensboro gaining over Jefferson during their Thanksgiving Day game (organized to replace the temporarily-relocated VPI-VMI game), while the final picture shows the Norfolk Shamrocks' Ken Batson getting tackled during the Travelers' 31-0 loss on November 16th [23]</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Images showing the many lives of the old grandstand and bleachers of the "Splinter Bowl," starting with the demolition of the grandstand in April 1941. Next shows the stands revived in the 1943 RoSox Park (as Maher Field was sometimes called), and then their re-demolition in 1954.  The other two images, both from 1946, show Maher Field II as a baseball park.  The final video shows a few scenes of baseball at the park, followed by the plant's demolition [24] [17]</figcaption>
