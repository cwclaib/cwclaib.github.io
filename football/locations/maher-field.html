<p>&emsp;&emsp;* Non-conference games</p>


<p>In late 1905, the Tidewater Railway purchased the grounds of Roanoke's first fairgrounds.  Taking the change in stride, the fair purchased the lands immediately to their south and opened <b>Fair Grounds II</b>, bringing the old grandstand, which sat about 2,500 persons, with them.  A second grandstand, seating about 4,000 persons, was also built.  These, as well as 1,500 bleacher seats (creating a total seated capacity of 8,000 persons), were all placed on the south side of the field, abutting the river, so they could be used for both baseball and horse racing action.  Additional bleachers were added along the first base line in 1909 and 1910, while the box seats were replaced in 1912 and temporary stands were placed inside the race track for the 1914 football season [1]].</p>

<p>In 1919, both the grandstands burnt down early in the morning of October 1st, resulting in a total loss of both structures just weeks before the start of the football season.  Unbelievably, the major college football games (of which NC State's contest against the Virginia Military Institute was the first) were not relocated to a new venue; instead, ownership went through the herculean effort of rebuilding the stands in the interim, starting work just a week prior to the VMI game.  About 3,000 seats were ready in time for the fray, while about 4,500 seats were ready for the Thanksgiving game later that month.  Another 3,000 bleacher seats were added during the 1920 football season.  In 1922, 1,200 bleachers were added to the north side of the field, 500 to the east side of the field, providing accommodations for 10,300 persons [2].</p>
<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/912170156/?match=1&terms=%22old%20grandstand%22 -->

<p>The Fair Grounds were sold in 1922 to David W. Flickwir, a chairperson for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, who flipped the property a year later to the rail company proper.  N&amp;W President Nicholas D. Maher announced that the grounds had nominally been acquired with rail expansion in mind, but that the typical fairs and athletic events would continue without interruption.  Actual intentions were most likely more multifaceted: first, the lomotive syndicate could improve the grounds in an effort to host more excursion trains for special events; second, the ground allowed Norfolk &amp; Western to engender intra-company athletics and bolster employee morale; and third, just some good-old-fashioned land speculation.  The land was sold for about $150,000 (over $2.8 million in 2025) [3].</p>

<p>At this time, papers began clamoring for the grounds to be renamed <b>Maher Field</b> (or Stadium) in honor of the rail magnates' generosity; it was formally renamed in late October 1924.  Immediately after taking charge, however, the field was enlarged with the extension of the grandstand seating on each end of the grandstand, pushing capacity to about 15,500 persons.  A rash of expansion closed out the roaring 20s, with 2,258 seats added behind the northern bleachers in 1928, another 2,500 in 1929<!-- location undetermined-->, and 350 stands in 1930 pushing seating from 18,000 to 20,000 to 20,350 resectively.  A scoreboard was installed for the first time in 1928 [4].</p>

<p>Despite a few additional improvements (a new press box added to the north bleachers in 1934, a new scoreboard and public address system in 1936, and a field house in 1939), the field began showing its age.  By the late 1930s, several prominent reporters had taken to calling the venue the "Splinter Bowl" in reference to the worn-out wooden seating around the field.  Athletic authorities at Virginia Tech and VMI began bandying for their long-standing "Military Classic of the South" to be relocated to new digs for the first time since 1905; rumors pointed predominantly towards Lynchburg's new concrete <a href="city-stadium-lynchburg.html">City Stadium</a>.  And after 1932, the grounds became sub-prime for baseball after N&amp;W authorities stopped taking down football bleachers, with hits over the northern bleachers resulting in a home run by rule [5].</p>
