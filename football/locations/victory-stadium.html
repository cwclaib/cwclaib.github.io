<body>
<p>Though it has been through a variety of changes, the earliest iteration of <b>River's Edge Park</b> first opened in 1893; it has never been the home field for any college football team.</p>

<p>Overall, NC State had a record of 4-1 at this field, going 2-1 in conference games, and 1-0 when ranked.  The 1904 game against Virginia Tech was canceled, probably while trying to schedule a game against UNC.</p>

<p>When Roanoke's <b>Athletic Park</b> first opened in early 1893, it was at least the town's third sporting venue in the Pleasant Valley district of town [1].  Though the reason for the move (and each of the previous moves) are unclear, the Roanoke Athletic Club began searching for a new plot of land in early April, and by April 18th, the location was selected, with initial plans calling for a baseball diamond and a quarter-mile track to be enclosed and adorned with a grandstand.  Work began just over a week later; the bulk of the work was completed by mid-May, though the 350-person grandstand took until May 27th, 1893; bleachers were added later that summer, and the grandstand rebuilt closer to the diamond in 1895, though no revised capacity was given [2].</p>

<p>Major improvements ceased after 1896, when semi-pro ball was suspended. Though it continued to see action for collegiate and amateur athletics, the park was now mostly an afterthought.  In May 1901, the bleachers collapsed, and by August a "substantial backstop" was constructed on the grounds to make way for the Roanoke Rifle Club.  Manager D. S. "Davy" Crockett was continually hopeful that a statewide league would revive professional baseball in Virginia's Magic City; though the grounds were revitalized in 1903 in anticipation of a new league, the miracle took a few more years to transpire [3].</p>

<p>In the meantime, another development was afoot in the Pleasant Valley neighborhood: Roanoke was establishing its own Agricultural Fair.  The idea of purchasing the baseball grounds for such a purpose was floated as early as February 1902, but nearby land was purchased instead.  The first three fairs, held 1903 through 1905, were held on a plot of land just north of the baseball park, bounded by Franklin Rd on the west, Rice St (now Woods Ave SW on the north; presumably, this extended towards the curent intersection of Jefferson and Williamson Rd SE), Jefferson St on the east, and Pleasant Avenue (now Naval Reserve Ave) on the south.  Though the Athletic Park continued to host some action, most major games transferred to the new Fair Grounds [4].</p>
<!-- first baseball I've found https://www.newspapers.com/image/911697668/?match=1&terms=%22baseball%20in%20roanoke%22%20%22fair%20grounds%22 -->
<!-- * An exact analog to Rice Street has not been found on extant digital maps or city directories.  Several advertized land sales, however, noted that Rice Street was now Woods Ave SW

https://www.newspapers.com/image/911644850/?match=1&terms=%22rice%20street%22  -->

<p>After the 1905 edition of the fair, the two neighbors performed something of a switcheroo.  The fair relocated one block southward after the Tidewater Railway (later the Virginian Railway, now a part of Norfolk Southern Railway) purchased their land to make way for a rail line; the old Athletic Park became a part of the new fair grounds in the process.  This put baseball interests in somewhat of a pickle: while the fair did intend to fix up the baseball grounds, the work wasn't to be completed until the fall, and with the entire surrounding land being generally reworked, the field was not in shape for Spring baseball.</p>

<p>Opening week drew closer and closer, but they still had no suitable playing field; the issue was further exacerbated since the team's manager took ill, forcing the cancellation of several pre-season exhibition games.  Local rooters thought the team may have to be abandoned for lack of grounds, but at the last second, a deal was struck with the railroad, allowing the team to use the old grandstand and field in the interim.  The arrangement lasted for the duration of the 1906 baseball season, though they may have played the latter portion without seating after the railroad ordered them to be removed [5].</p>

<p>By September 1906, the new fairgrounds were finally ready.  In addition to the old grandstand, which sat about 2,500 persons, a second grandstand was built, seating about 4,000 persons, with total covered capacity estimated to be about 7,000 persons.  These, as well as 1,500 bleacher seats, were all placed on the south side of the field, abutting the river, so they could be used for both baseball and horse racing action.  Additional bleachers were added along the first base line in 1909 and 1910, while the box seats were replaced in 1912 and temporary stands were placed inside the race track for the 1914 football season [6].</p>

<p>In 1919, both the old grandstands burnt down early in the morning of October 1st, resulting in a total loss of both structures just weeks before the start of the football season.  Unbelievably, the major college football games (of which NC State's contest against the Virginia Military Institute was the first) were not relocated to a new venue; instead, the herculean effort of rebuilding the stands, starting just a week prior to the VMI game.  About 3,000 seats were ready in time for the fray, while about 4,500 seats were ready for the Thanksgiving game.  Another 3,000 bleacher seats were added during the 1920 football season.  In 1922, 1,200 bleachers were added to the north side of the field, 500 to the east side of the field, providing accommodations for 10,300 persons [7].</p>
<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/912170156/?match=1&terms=%22old%20grandstand%22 -->

<p>The Fair Grounds were sold twice in 1922 to David W. Flickwir, a chairperson for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, who flipped the property a year later to the rail company proper.  N&amp;W President Nicholas D. Maher announced that the grounds had nominally been acquired with rail expansion in mind, but that the typical fairs and athletic events would continue without interruption.  Actual intentions were more multifaceted three-fold: first, the lomotive syndicate could improve the grounds in an effort to host more excursion trains for special events; second, to foster intra-company athletics and bolster employee morale; and third, just some good-old-fashioned land speculation.  The land was sold for about $150,000 (over $2.8 million in 2025) [8].</p>

<p>At this time, papers began clamoring for the grounds to be renamed <b>Maher Field</b> or Stadium in honor of the rail magnates' generosity, though it was not formally renamed until late October 1924.  Immediately after taking charge, however, the field was enlarged with the extension of the grandstand seating on each end of the grandstand, pushing capacity to about 15,500 persons.  A rash of expansion closed out the roaring 20s, with 2,258 seats added behind the northern bleachers in 1928, another 2,500 in 1929<!-- location undetermined-->, and 350 stands in 1930 pushing seating from 18,000 to 20,000 to 21,000 resectively
