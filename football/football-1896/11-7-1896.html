<p>The sole recorded game of A&ampM's 1896 season was a fairly minor game that pitted A&ampM's oldest two classes against the younger two.  The game was described by the <i>News and Observer</i> as "interesting" and reportedly attended by "several hundred people."  The upperclassmen team won the toss and chose to defend the north goal.  Confusingly, the paper reports that D. Clark, a member of the freshman-sophomore team, kicked the ball 30 yards from midfield.  From there, "The Freshmen got the ball" but soon thereafter lost the ball on downs.  The ball remained in the southern half of the field for quite some time until Wooten made a "beautiful end run" for 40 yards and a touchdown.  Carroll kicked the goal for the upperclassmen, making the score 6-0 for the older boys.</p>

<p>The remainder of the half was not worth being reported on, but after 15 total minutes of play, the half ended with the ball on the underclassmen's 15 yard line.</p>

<p>The second half was started with a 35 yard kick by Carroll.  Pierce caught the kick for the younger team, but the ball was soon lost on a fumble, where it was recovered by the older boys.  A feature of the second half was the work of the "plucky little Jap," Sugishita, especially a "beautiful" end run on a double pass for a 40-yard gain.  Wooten later ran the ball another 20 yards for his second touchdown of the day.  Carroll kicked his second successful goal kick of the day, and the score sat at 12-0 in favor of the upperclassmen.</p>

<p>Other features of the game included runs of an unspecified distance by Copeland, of the underclassmen's team, the "end runs and line bucking" of Kendall and Wooten, and the tackling of Asbury for the upperclassmen's team.</p>

<p>Officiating for the game was done by Charles Pearson and A. Thompson, though who umpired and who refereed was not specified.  Reportedly, their work was "to the satisfaction of both sides" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/78558603/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 8th, 1896</a>, p. 5).</p>
