<p>Perhaps the most physically talented of the football teams the Farmers played in 1911 was their fifth game, against the Naval Academy.  The Navy was consistently among the best teams in the southeast, constant churning out wins.  Though forbidden by faculty from playing any games off of home grounds except for the venerable Army-Navy game*, the Midshipmen (often contracted to "Middies") remained one of the biggest draws of football along the Atlantic due to the exceptionally strong teams they consistently put out.  When NC A&ampM played Navy in 1911, it had been 2 full years since their most recent loss, back on October 30th, 1909 against Princeton; it would be another year before that streak was broken.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of new coach Douglas Howard, a former Tar himself, the Middies pattern of domination had largely been maintained: the Annapolis boys won their first three games by a combined margin of 64-5, being scored upon only in their season opener against Johns Hopkins, which they won 27-5; they also defeated St. Johns of Maryland and Washington &amp Jefferson by 21- and 16-to-nothing, respectively.  Interestingly, Johns Hopkins was the first team to score on the Tars since 1909; they went through all of 1910 unscored upon.</p>

<p>Their subsequent two games were both scoreless ties, one expectedly coming at the hands of a strong Princeton team, but the second, against Western Reserve, coming as something of a surprise.  Around the country, it was seen as a massive blow to the prowess of the Sailors, and was mentioned frequently in post-game articles.  However, some also noted the bruised leg of Dalton, who had been largely unable to practice due to his injury.</p>

<p>The Aggies left for Annapolis on Thursday night.  The Farmers stayed the night somewhere outside of Annapolis and arrived in the city before noon on Saturday; though not explicitly stated, this was likely to get one final practice in with some privacy before venturing to enemy territory (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58154417/?terms=navy%20football&match=1"><i>The Raleigh Daily Times</i>, November 3rd, 1911</a>, p. 2; <a href="https://www.genealogybank.com/doc/newspapers/image/v2%3A16D0E95D1C55F8B6%40GB3NEWS-16DF192FE2C4842B%402419345-16DF195A7038F3AB%404-16DF195A7038F3AB%40?h=20&fname=&mname=&lname=&kwinc=football%20navy%20farmers&kwexc=&rgfromDate=1911&rgtoDate=&formDate=&formDateFlex=exact&dateType=range&processingtime=&addedFrom=&addedTo=&sort=old&page=1&sid=ggxscishcczuiecrbqhtwmnyylehadln_wma-gateway008_1637725173575"><i>The (Annapolis) Evening Capital</i>, November 4th, 1911</a>, p. 4).  Sadly, papers did not give any indication as to what the team did to practice in the intervening week since their last game.</p>

<p>The papers did, however, make one important remark during their departure: the faculty had constructed a visual way to display the game to the students who stayed in Raleigh.  Using a play-by-play relayed via telegraph to Pullen Hall, students could 'watch' the game: "a board has been arranged to correspond to a full size gridiron, [and] upon this board the plays will be placed as they are received over wire, in order that every one may understand the plays will be called off as they are received."**  Attendance was 50 cents (about $15 in 2019) to cover the cost of the special cable (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58154417/?terms=navy%20football&match=1"><i>The Raleigh Daily Times</i>, November 3rd, 1911</a>, p. 2).  This appears to be the first known time an NC State away game was relayed as a play-by-play to students.</p>

<p>Navy, on the other hand, had been practicing fairly rigorously after their shocking non-win against Western Reserve.  On the Thursday before the game, the team was run through "the stiffest kind of scrimmage," devoted almost entirely to offensive work (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/372098291/?terms=navy%20football&match=1"><i>The (Baltimore) Sun</i>, November 3rd, 1911</a>, p. 10).  The Friday before the game the team was held to lighter work, focusing on only signals and formation drills.  Local reports warned of the speediness of the A&ampM team in contrast to the heavier Sailors, though they also noted that the other teams they had played primarily had lighter teams (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/372100161/?terms=navy%20football&match=1"><i>The (Baltimore) Sun</i>, November 4th, 1911</a>, p. 12).  Notably, Dalton had also been practicing for the week (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/365446765/?terms=navy%20football&match=1"><i>The (Baltimore) Evening Sun</i>, November 4th, 1911</a>, p. 8).</p>

<p>* Navy had not played a game away from home aside from the Army-Navy game since their 1904 game against Virginia, and would not again until their 1914 game against Penn.</p>

<p>** Though not explicitly stated, this device sounds exactly like an early version of a device known as a "grid-o-graph" or "grid-graph" which was especially popular from the 1920s to 1930s, when it was largely replaced by radio broadcasts.  1911 is the earliest date I have come across the use of a grid-graph, with Michigan implementing one in 1913 <!--https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/mattice.htm--> and Oregon in 1915<!--http://www.benzduck.com/journal/2011/12/26/broadcasting-the-1917-rose-bowl.html-->.  Here is a description of a mechanical grid-graph (A&ampM's likely was), as described on <a href="http://www.benzduck.com/journal/2011/12/26/broadcasting-the-1917-rose-bowl.html">Duck Downs</a>:<blockquote>"The contraption on the stage was a miniature football field, slightly inclined at the back for ease of visibility to the crowd, made of plywood. Above the field was suspended a small football, connected to a series of pulleys and strings that allowed an operator to move the ball back and forth. Western Union ran a telegraph line from the Broadway station to the Heilig, where McKevitt would set up his portable “ticker” backstage.  McKevitt would translate the dots and dashes received from the remote game transmitter into English, relay them to the guy with a megaphone, who would in turn announce the play by play results to the Heilig’s audience, while the boy running the pulleys would move the ball back and forth across the field, and another would track the score on a small scoreboard.</blockquote>.</p>
