<p>The Farmers took a long break after their close game against Virginia, going nearly three weeks without a game.  After playing UVA, the team felt it had "discovered its weak points" and made "every effort to strengthen them."  In addition to their usual practices, a free matchup between the first and second teams of A&ampM was advertised publicly, with free admission for any who wanted to watch.  The practice game was played at 4:30 PM on Tuesday, October 24th, before the Varsity team left for South Carolina; this game had the added benefit of giving the scrubs one more public practice game before their matchup in Red Springs, NC, against the North Carolina Military Academy.  The practice was good for both teams; the Varsity team won 32-0 before leaving for Columbia on the night of October 25th, while the scrub team beat the Military Academy 27-0 (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58960366/?terms=%22A.%2Band%2BM.%2Bcollege%22%2Bfootball"><i>The Raleigh Evening Times</i>, October 11th, 1905</a>, p. 1; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75788514/?terms=%22A.%2Band%2BM.%2Bcollege%22%2Bfootball"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 24th, 1905</a>, p. 8; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58960490/?terms=columbia%2Bfootball%2Bcarolina"><i>The Raleigh Evening Times</i>, October 25th, 1905</a>, p. 3; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58960505/?terms=columbia%2Bfootball%2Bcarolina"><i>The Raleigh Evening Times</i>, October 26th, 1905</a>, p. 1; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/57504455/?terms=columbia%2Bfootball%2Bcarolina"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, October 26th, 1905</a>, p. 5).</p>

<p>Before the A&ampM cadets left for Columbia and the South Carolina State Fair, a few minor changes were made to the team's starting lineup.  Thompson, who was the Red and White's starting quarterback for the first two games of the season, was replaced by Steele, a new player.  Thompson was supposed to move to to left end, a position which had been first by Clardy and second by Coffin.  Thompson, however, did not play in the South Carolina game, with Clardy returning to his original role instead.  Clardy's second spot, at left tackle, was filled by Tull, who had previously been a sub (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/57504455/?terms=columbia%2Bfootball%2Bcarolina"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, October 26th, 1905</a>, p. 5).</p>

<p>The Garnet and Black of South Carolina, on the other hand, had yet to face a real challenge this season.  The Gamecocks opened their season on October 13th with a 14-0 win over Welsh Neck High School (now Coker University, in Hartsville, South Carolina) and followed that win up with a second win a week later over the Robert Bingham School of Asheville, this time by a score of 18-6.  South Carolina's team was reported to be in "good condition" before the game (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/668523216/?terms=university%2Bfootball"><i>The (Sumter, SC) Watchman and Southron</i>, October 25th, 1905</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>It is not completely clear which team started with the ball first.  The identical game summary published in both <i>The Morning Post</i> and <i>News and Observer</i> start their description of the game with South Carolina kicking the ball but fail to describe the second half; <i>Red and White</i> wrote that the second half opened with South Carolina kicking off, but failed to describe the first half in any significant detail.  As such, it seems likely that A&ampM kicked off to South Carolina to start the game; from there, the South Carolinians were unable to convert, forcing the Gamecocks to kick the ball away.  Though not mentioned in the rest of the game summary, at the start of the newspapers' description it was reported that South Carolina "held her own well" and forced the Farmers to kick "several times" throughout the game.</p>

<p>The Garnet and Black then kicked off, sending the ball to Hardy, who caught the ball but was downed by Croft.  From there, "a series of heavy smashes" carried the ball the bulk of the distance down the field, to within 20 yards of the Gamecocks' goal.  Unfortunately, the Farmers' first drive ended on a fumble, which gave the ball to South Carolina.  The Gamecocks elected to kick the ball further downfield instantly, and the kick was recovered by the Red and White.  In taking the ball back up the field, the Raleigh boys twice pulled off the "Heisman delayed pass trick" for 20 total yards of gain.  Finally, after ten minutes of play in the first half, Beebee carried the ball over the goal line for the touchdown.  Hardy made the kick, and the score became 6 to 0.</p>

<p>After being scored upon, South Carolina elected to receive the kick.  The Aggies kicked the ball to the Gamecocks, who successfully fielded the kick, but fumbled the ball on the second play of their subsequent drive.  Through "hard work and quick gains," the ball was brought to within 3 yards of the goal line, at which point Hardy carried it across.  Hardy made the second goal, and after about one-and-a-half more minutes of play, the Farmers were up 12 to 0.</p>

<p>At this point, the only newspaper account of the game I could find, from <i>The Morning Post</i>, stopped describing the game, writing "From then on to the end of the chapter it was the same old story."  As such, the remainder of the game's description comes from <i>Red and White</i> alone.</p>

<p>A&ampM received the next kick at their own 25 yard line.  The Farmers advanced the ball a little bit, but after failing to convert before their third and final down, "Babe" Wilson decided to punt the ball 30 yards up the field.  Upon receiving the kick, Carolina was unable to advance it, and turned the ball over on downs back to A&ampM.  After a few short runs, "Babe" carried the ball the remaining 25 yards to cross the goal line.  No comment on whether the kick was made or missed.  This touchdown was the final play noted in the first half.  The score sat at approximately 18 to 0.</p>

<p>The second half started off with a bang.  South Carolina kicked off, with Hardy again waiting to return the kick.  He fielded the kick around the 10 yard line, and then carried the ball the remaining 100 yards to the goal line "like a flash" for a touchdown, aided by some "pretty interference."  Hardy's play was reportedly so good it even earned the applause of the South Carolina fans at the fair.  The goal kick was not mentioned, leaving the score at approximately 24 to 0.</p>

<p>The final touchdown of the game was not described in any report I could find.  The final score was 29 to 0, A&ampM, meaning that one goal kick was missed at some point after the first two touchdowns.  Also, at some point in the game, the Gamecocks made a 30 yard gain; when this took place is not specified, but her ground gaining was generally undone by "costly fumbles" and a stout Red and White defense.</p>

<p>A feature of the game was reported to be Wilson's punting, as was the work of Steele's "cool and fast" playing, and the work of Lykes, Shaw, Hardy, Tull, and Beebee for the Farmers.  Hardy in particular was described as "a Whole Team in Himself."  For South Carolina, the best work was done by Holmes, Wilds and Gibbs (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v7n3#?c=&m=&s=&cv=8&xywh=-59%2C740%2C2906%2C1702"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. VII No. 3 (November 1905)</a>, pp. 118-119; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/57504486/?terms=%22south%2Bcarolina%22%2B%22north%2Bcarolina%22%2B%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bcolumbia"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, October 27th, 1905</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>Newspapers emphasized the significant disparity in weights between the two teams, concluding that South Carolina was essentially destined to lose due to the differential: A&ampM was reported to be an average of 17 pounds heavier, weighing an average of 173 pounds as opposed to the more meager 156 pounds of South Carolina's team.  As <i>The Morning Post</i> summarized, "It was a case of a very heavy team meeting a light."  The Sumter, South Carolina <i>Watchman and Southron</i> put it more bluntly: "The [A&ampM] Tar Heels were entirely too heavy for the [South] Carolina boys and made mince meat of them in short order."  The paper also reported that the play was rather rough, which other papers failed to mention (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/89021686/?terms=%22south%2Bcarolina%22%2B%22A.%2Band%2BM.%2Bcollege%22"><i>The Watchman and Southron</i>, November 1st, 1905</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>Following their loss to the Farmers, South Carolina would go on to beat Davidson 6-4 in Charlotte.  The following week, the Gamecocks would head up to Asheville to play a second game against the Robert Bingham School; one of the few Varsity teams the 2-2-2 record Bingham cadets played that year, the Asheville cadets managed to pull off a 5-5 tie, aided by several star players who returned from injuries, though South Carolina did complain of unfair treatment by the Asheville umpires.  According to some papers, a slight rivalry had developed between the two schools despite not having played since 1902.  The next week, South Carolina was smashed by Virginia Polytechnic Institute 0-34, but then closed their season on a high note with a 47-0 Thanksgiving Day victory over the first football team ever fielded by The Citadel.</p>
