<p>The A&ampM and Oak Ridge teams left from Greensboro the morning of December 1st and took a train to Winston.  Though the game had originally been scheduled for Saturday, December 2nd, the teams lost out on the day of rest due to a scheduling error: Guilford College had scheduled a game against the Davis Military School, a school based out of Winston, in the same park on the same day.  Guilford would go on to win their game 12-0 (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76208186/?terms=%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball"><i>News-Observer-Chronicle</i>, November 30th, 1893</a>, p. 1; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/81122244/?terms=winston%2Bguilford%2Bdavis%2B%22foot-ball%22"><i>The Union Republican</i>, December 7th, 1893</a>, p. 3).</p>

<p>The second match between the two teams "was by far a more scientific and hotly contested game."  The game was described in other papers as "interesting and fine" and "an exciting, well-played game."  It was also said that "Both teams are young, both are so game."  Unfortunately, this game--reportedly better in every way--was detailed much less than the previous day's game.  It was played in the evening and witnessed by a "very enthusiastic crowd," but details of the game are few and far between (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76208208/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22"><i>News-Observer-Chronicle</i>, December 2nd, 1893</a>, pp. 1, 4; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/72450164/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2Bfootball"><i>Daily Charlotte Observer</i>, December 2nd, 1893</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>There were, however, some aspects of the game that entered public record.  "The main features of the game for A. and M. College was [sic] running and tackling of Hughes, McRae [sic] and Whitaker, the brilliant end plays of Vick and the centre playing of Mosely.  For Oak Ridge, was the splendid running and tackling of King and the systematic playing of the whole team."  Reportedly much of the success of the Farmers was due to the "flying V" formation that was popular at the time, with A&ampM making 30 yards' progress on the very first down of the game.  A&ampM had also been practicing "Yale plays," and reportedly executed them "with admirable perfection" and "much success."  The game was played in "only" thirty minute halves as compared to the then-standard 45-minute halves of the time.  A&ampM won the game 12-6.  One paper, comparing the scores of the first and second game between the two teams, quipped "The girls of the Normal and Industrial were out in full force on Thursday and shouted for A. &amp M., and consequently the score was run up to 24 to 8 against Oak Ridge.  The next day at Winston, lacking this kindly influence, a score of 12 to 6 against Oak Ridge was the result" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/76208239/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2Bfootball"><i>News-Observer-Chronicle</i>, December 6th, 1893</a>, p. 1).</p>

<p>The game marked the end of A&ampM's first true season of football.  Though the team started off with a tough loss, they closed the season with a 4-game winning streak over similarly experienced teams and had started to truly develope and grow as a football program.</p>
