<p>Though this game is listed on NC State's official list of football games for the 1893 season, I have been unable to find a source to substantiate the game.  Firstly, it is not mentioned in any of the main books covering NC State football <i>The Wolfpack</i> by Bill Beezley, <i>Go Wolfpack</i> by Thad Mumau, or <i>Touchdown Wolfpack!</i> by Douglas Herakovich), or the early history of NC State football written by <a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v9n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=3&xywh=-759%2C0%2C5931%2C3473">Joel Whitaker</a> in 1907.  Secondly, I could find no indication in digitized newspaper collections that the game had been played.  Finally, earning a score of 13 at this time would have been rather difficult, as touchdowns earned a team 4 points and the goal kick earned a team 2 points. The only way a team could have scored 13 points would have been by scoring two touchdowns, missing both goal after kicks, and then kicking the ball between the goal posts with a drop kick for 5 points.</p>

<p>The game was, however, offhandedly- and indirectly-referenced by <a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v12n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=3&xywh=1362%2C759%2C2943%2C1724">C. D. Harris</a> in his generally-error-riddled 1910 history of NC State football, where he summarized the 1893 season dubiously as follows: "the 'prep.' schools, with the exception of Morson and Denson's [also known as the Raleigh Male Academy], were left out, and a schedule with the colleges of the State was arranged, including games with Davidson, Trinity, Wake Forest, and the university [of North Carolina] scrubs."  I could find no evidence that any of those games aside from the games against UNCâ€™s scrubs took place, while Harris also left off the verifiable games played against Oak Ridge.</p>

<p>All of these facts make me strongly doubt that this game ever happened.</p>
