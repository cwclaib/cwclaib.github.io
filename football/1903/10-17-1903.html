<p>The Farmer boys left Raleigh on October 16th, just before the start of the local North Carolina State Fair.  When the team left, some reports claimed they still intended to play the game against Maryland, in Roanoke; local reports in Raleigh did not mention any of the other games planned for the Virginia trip, though games against St. Albans' School and Maryland had been mentioned in schedules throughout the season (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/56302617/?terms=team"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, October 17th, 1903</a>, p. 8; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58543305/?terms=%22north%2Bcarolina%22%2B%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bfootball%2B%22university%2Bof%2Bmaryland%22%2Broanoke"><i>The Charlotte News</i>, October 17th, 1903</a>, p. 3).  In general, the game was widely overshadowed in both pre- and post-game coverage by the North both Carolina-Virginia Military Virginia Tech game, a highly anticipated game which resulted in a large 28-6 Tar Heel win in Roanoke, Virginia, and preperations for the incipient State Fair and a related banquet for Confederate veterans.</p>

<p>The Maroon and Orange had not played much football to this point in 1903.  Led by first-year head coach Charles Leuder, who played football at Cornell, had played just one game so far in their season, defeating the nearby St. Albans School 29-0 on October 14th.</p>

<p>The day was not ideal for football weather.  Reports from Roanoke and much of the East Coast of the United States expected rain, and Blacksburg was no exception to that.  As will be alluded below, the day was an exceptionally wet one, with multiple mistakes on both sides being attributed to the wetness of the weather.  The National Weather Service recorded three quarters of an inch of percipitation.</p>
<!-- heavy rain lasting for 2-4 hours

<p>Because football coverage in both North Carolina and Virginia was so heavily focused on the UNC-VMI game, only one detailed report of the game exists: a heavily-damaged copy of the first edition of <i>The Virginia Tech</i>.  In an effort to make the events of the game more readable, I have transcribed the existing report from <i>The Virginia Tech</i>, filling in missing or damaged words to the best of my knowledge, and have added commentary afterwards.  Words which I am less sure about are <i>italicized</i>, while complete guesses as colored <span style="color:red">red</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>N. C. A. &amp M. Coll[ege] Game</b></p>

<p>Despite the inclement weather, a large and enthusiastic [crowd] gathered to see the Polytech[s] go up against their [old] rivals from North Carolina, the [team] representing the Agricultural [and] Mechanical College.  All present expected an interesting [con]test, nor were they [dis]app[oint]ed, for the Tar Heels, [though] clearly outclassed, played a g[<i>rit</i>]ty game, especially during the [secon]d half. At no time, ho[wever, wa]s V. P. I.'s goal in danger, [or d]id her backs ever fail to gain [the re]quisite five yards. Whenever called upon, Councilman, [Ho]dgson and Bird [sic] charged [<i>ma</i>]nfully through the opening [<i><span style="color:red">made</span></i>] for them by our line, [<i>and to</i>]ok all that was coming to [them] in the way of yards, while Carpenter, during the few minutes of [his] play as left half, showed up [<i>with his</i>] old-time brilliancy as [<i><span style="color:red">a ground</span></i>] gainer.  To Carpe[nter] [---] be credited more th[----] [<i>beau</i>]tiful punt, and as [---] kick [--- *several lines of text obscured beyond readability* ---] [<span style="color:red"><i>phe</i></span>]nominal gains, [---] sloppy field cut [Shannon]house's skilful deto[urs ---] end.  Altogether in [<i>38</i> ---] straight football on [--- <i>fie</i>]ld against a strong team. [<span style="color:red"><i>The</i></span> bo]ys from V. P. I. gave a fa[ir] sample of the claim they are ready to make for the championship of the South.</p>

<p>The following is an outline of the game:</p>

<p>The Polytechnics kicked off to A. &amp M.'s 20-yard line, where the ball was stopped without being returned. A. &amp M. then sent Welch against the line, but nothing was gained.  Shannonhouse gained 3 yards over Wilson.  An attempt was made to kick, but the kick was blocked and Miles fell on the ball.  Councilman made two gains of 7 yards each through the center, and was then pushed over the line for the first touch down. Wilson kicked the ball out but Hodgson failed to make catch, causing failure of goal. Score, 5 to 0, favor V. P. I. Time, [<i>one</i>] minute and quarter.</p>

<p>A. &amp M. kicked ball to 15-yard line. Hodgson, by a pretty run, returned it 20 yards. Hodgson then went through Koon for 10 yards and again through Koon for [8] yards. The ball was then fumbled by the Polytechnics and Buckley fell on it. Abernathy gained 1-1/2 yards. A. &amp M. then tried the quarter back run, but Buckley failed to gain. Welch then tried the line, but made only 1 yards. The ball went over to V. P. I. on downs.</p>

<p>Councilman went over Abernathy for 3 yards and Bird [sic] through the same man for 3 yards. Councilman struck Gaither for 8 yards and repeated the performance for 5 yards more. Bird [sic] went through Abernathy for 5 yards, then Hodgson for 4 yards, then Bird [sic] for 4 yards and again Hodgson for 4 yards, followed by Councilman over Gaither and Wilson for 5 yards. Councilman made the same play twice in succession and gained 8 yards each time. Bird rushed over Neal for 4 yards and then charged Wilson for the same amount of gain.</p>

<p>Councilman was sent through Gaither for 4 yards and left the ball two yards from the goal line. Councilman broke through Wilson for touch down, but on account of A. &amp M.'s being offside the play was tried again, V. P. I. refusing to claim penalty against A. &amp M.  Councilman made the same play and scored the second touch down. Miles kicked goal. Score, 11 to [0.] Time, 8 minutes.</p>

<p>A. &amp M. kicked ball over the [goa]l line. V. P. I. brought it out [to the] 25-yard line, from which [place] Carpenter kicked to Welch, but before any gain could be made Robbins [sic] had the man down. Shannonhouse clipped off two yards, but Koon was stopped in his tracks. A &amp M. then kicked the ball back of V. P. I.'s goal line.  Carpenter kicked off from the 25-yard line; it was received by Buckley, who returned it by a clever run for 15 yards.</p>

<p>Welch was forced through the line for 4-1/2 yards, and followed the play by another which netted 1 yard. Abernathy tried a play on Abbott, but before nay headway was made Robbins [sic] had broken up the interference, and tackled his man behind the line, causing a loss of 1 yard.  Shannonhouse went through for 1 yard and again for 3 yards. Having failed to make the necessary 5 yards, the ball went over to the Polytechnics.</p>

<p>Hodgson went over neal for 5 yards and Councilman broke over Gaither twice for more than 5 yards each time. Bird [sic] then [cha]rged over Neal for 5 yards, [closely] followed by Councilman, who struck Gaither for 4 yards, and Bird [sic] once more hit Neal, this time for 4 yards gain.</p>

<p>Councilman plunged into Wilson for 1 yard, and then tried Gaither making the second time three yards. Hodgson was sent over Koon for 2 yards and then Councilman gained [<i>6</i>] yards over Gaither.</p>

<p>During the last play Gaither's ankle was severely sprained, which accident caused hom to retire from the game. Hadley was then put in to play center.</p>

<p>Hodgson was pushed over the line, when the play began, for 5 yards and [was] followed by Councilman, who gained [<i>4</i>] yards over Hadley.</p>

<p>Bird, Councilman and Hodg[son] were forced through the line in rapid succession for material [gains] the man with the ball making several yards on each play.  Councilman put an end to the fierceness of the bucking by going over the line for the third touch down. Miles failed to kick goal. Score, 16 to 0. Time, 18 minutes.</p>

<p>A. &amp M. kicked the ball to Carpenter, who returned it to the 5-yard line by a beautiful punt of 80 yards.  Welch had gained 1 yard when the whistle [sound]ed for the end of the first half, the ball being down 6 yard[s] from A. &amp M.'s goal line. Score, 16 to 0. Time, 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second half opened up [with] A. &amp M.'s kick off. The [ball] went outside, and the kick [was] tried again. This time Carpenter received it and returned the kick, but by kicking low failed to make any very material gain, the ball having been [blocked.  Fortunately] for V. P. I. [---], [Hodgson] fell on the ball and it was down near the 25-yard line. Miles [went] though Neal for [<span style="color:red"><i>4</i></span>]. Councilman, who followed [the] play, was thrown back.  [Carpent]er kicked the ball and the ball [went out]side at the 40-yard line. A. &amp M. opened up the play in the middle [of] the field but before any damage could be done, Councilman broke through the line and tackled Shannonhouse, causing thereby a loss of 2 yards.</p>

<p>Shannonhouse then broke through for 2 yards.  Miller kicked but the ball went outside at the 30-yard line.  V. P. I. then started the play in the middle of the field.  Hodgson ran round Gulley's end for 50 yards.  It was one of the prettiest runs of the game.  Councilman gained 3 yards over Hadley, Wilson ran 15 over [Aber]nathy.  Hodgson stole through [Neal] for three yards, and then Bird [sic] ran round Lyke's end for 15 yards. The ball was down on the [<i>15</i>] yard line, but was fumbled and A. &amp M. got it.  Here, the North Carolinians braced up and played their prettiest part of the game.  Welch went round left end for 15 yards. Having passed every [man] in line, Welch was making headway for the Polytechnics goal, but was stopped by Hodgson on the dodge.  Unfortunately for the A. &amp M.'s, Welch slipped, thereby enabling Hodgson to more easily stop him.  This was A. &amp M.'s only chance in the game to score, but the slick ground and Hodgson soon put an end to the chance.</p>

<p>Miller gained 3 yards, followed by [Neal] who made 4 yards.  [Abernathy] chipped off [4] yards and Shannonhouse followed for 1-1/2 yards.</p>

<p>Neal [charged] the line, but lost 1 yard. Shannonhouse went over for [--] yards.  Shannonhouse [hit] right tackle again, but [failed] to gain.  [M]iller went through center for 1/2 yard, Buckley tried his quarter back trick again, but Robbins [sic] [broke it up] after a gain of one yard [had been made].  Miller then [punted].  Hodgson received the punt and ret[urn]ed the ball about 5 yards, being on the 40-yard line.  [Ho]dgson then went around Gulley's end for 5 yards, but the play was called back; this time Bird [sic] went over Koon for 4 yards.  Shannonhouse became indisposed during the last play and Sieford [sic; Seifert] [took] his place.</p>

<p>Council[man] went over Hadley for [<i>2-1/2</i> <span style="color:red"><i>yards.</i></span>] Hodgson stole round G[ulley's] end for 15 yards. Bird [sic] [<i>stole round</i>] Lyke's end, but made [<span style="color:red"><i>no</i></span>] yards.  Bird [sic] was [---] oblig[ed --- favor].</p>

<p>W[--- made] 5 [yards <span style="color:red"><i>over</i></span>] Koon [<i>when play</i>] resumed.  Hod[gson ------] Gu[lley's end ---] to gain ground.  Counc[ilman ---] two plays over Hadley [---] yards on the first [---] the second one Ho[dgson --- *several lines of text obscured beyond readability* ---] a beautiful kick [from] the [-- ya]rd line sending the ball straight under the goal post for 5 points.  Score 21 to 0. Time 14 minutes.</p>

<p>A. &amp M. kicked to Carpenter on the 5 yard line. Carpenter returned kick for 60 yards. A. &amp M. then sent Seiford [sic] forward for 4 yards and followed with Koon for [1] yard. Wilson (A. &amp M.) hit center for 1/2 yard and Koon tried another play over Wilson in which he failed to [gain].  Miller attempted to kick but fumbled and the ball went over to V. P. I. on the 40-yard line.</p>

<p>At this stage of the game Brent was put in at quarter-back in Carpenter's place while Carpenter relieved Hodgson, who retired from the game.</p>

<p>Councilman went over Hadley for 2 yards.  [Car]penter ran around Ly[ke's] end for 20 yards and then round Gulley's end for 10 yards. Here the whistle blew for the end of the game, with the ball 10 yards from A. &amp M.'s goal line, V. P. I. having a splendid chance for another touch down.</p>

<p>Score, 21 to 0. Time, 18 minutes (<a href="http://digitalsc.lib.vt.edu/items/show/7089"><i>The Virginia Tech</i>, October 21st, 1903</a>, pp. 1-3.</p></blockquote>

<p>As can be seen by the game summary above, the Virginians dominated the game, scoring a 5-point field goal kick, three touchdowns, and one goal kick.  Though the Maroon and Orange team did elect to kick the ball away a few times, they never lost the ball on downs due to a failure to convert; the Red and White, on the other hand, rarely made a first down.  As <i>The Virginia Tech's</i> writers did acknowledge, Welch could have scored a touchdown for the Farmers had he not "slipped and fell fairly into the arms of the V. P. I. quarterback [sic; Hodgson, not Carpenter, stopped Welch]" due to the wet field.  The Farmers congratulated themselves on keeping the score as low as they did.</p>

<p>The biggest players of the game were Hodgson, Carpenter, and Councilman for the Polytechnics, while for A&ampM the best work was done by Welch and Shannonhouse (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v5n3#?c=&m=&s=&cv=13&xywh=4189%2C1120%2C3144%2C1841"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. V, No. 3 (November 1903)</a>, p. 11; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/605125023/?terms=%22V.%2BP.%2BI.%22"><i>The Norfolk Landmark</i>, October 18th, 1903</a>, p. 1).  Despite the steep loss, the game was said to be "one of the best games put up during the season" (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/agromeck1904nort#?c=&m=&s=&cv=147&xywh=60%2C771%2C1990%2C1165"><i>The Agromeck</i>, Vol. II (1904)</a>, p. 142).  In a retrospective on A&ampM football written in 1910, C. D. Harris recalled that "heavy kicking won the game" for VPI (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v12n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=7&xywh=-205%2C1334%2C3620%2C2120"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. XII, No. 4 (December 1910)</a>, p. 178</p>

<p>The <i>Red and White</i> praised the hospitality of the Blacksburg boys, in contrast to their previous game in Lexington, writing "Our stay at V. P. I. will always be remembered for the kind and generous treatment we received at the hands of the students.  Nothing was too good for us, and in every possible way the V. P. I. boys showed that they are true gentlemen in the fullest sense of the word" (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v5n3#?c=&m=&s=&cv=13&xywh=4189%2C1120%2C3144%2C1841"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. V, No. 3 (November 1903)</a>, p. 11).</p>

<p>The Polytechnics went on to have a very good season.  Though they lost their subsequent game 0-21 against in-state rival Virginia on October 24th in Richmond before winning their next three games, defeating North Carolina 21-0 in Norfolk, besting the Navy team 11-0 in Annapolis, and downing Davidson 26-0.</p>
