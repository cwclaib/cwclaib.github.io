			The eastern side of the island was also used for other recreation activities including baseball and
                  football. In April 1921, Mayo Island Park opened for Virginia League baseball games. The Park
                  was later named Tate Field. Major League exhibition games were also played at Mayo Island
                  Park and included a 1922 game in which Babe Ruth hit a home run over the right-field fence. The
                  last baseball game was played at the Park in 194 L'

                  Colleges played football in the Park between 1921 and 1928. The University of Richmond,
                  William and Mary, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of
                  North Carolina, and Harnpden-Sydney college were some of the teams that played there. Once
                  the City Stadium w; as built in 1929, college football was no longer played on the island, although
                  high school teams played there for a few more years.
