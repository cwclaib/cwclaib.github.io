<p>The Spring 1892 football season was the first year organized, intercollegiate football was played at NC State, then known as North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, or NC A&ampM for short.  The first game, played in the Spring of 1892, was played just under three years after the college opened.  Before we look into NC State's first football season,  however, let's take a quick look at the history of the school up to that point.</p>

<p>NC A&ampM traces its roots to a group of forward-looking citizens of Raleigh who created a group known as the Watauga Club.  The Watauga Club was formed in May of 1884 so those citizens could discuss in private how to best advance the state economically, with discussion often focusing on the need for a state industrial school.  The club was initially somewhat secretive due to its discussion of what were in the postbellum South viewed as somewhat progressive subjects, leading some to theorize that it was a gambling club.  Eventually, however, the club and its ideas, with the help of Watauga club-member Walter Hines Page's paper, the <i>State Chronicle</i> (and later Leonidas Polk's <i>Progressive Farmer</i>, which focused more on the need for an agricultural college), became recognized and accepted by the people of the state (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/mc00229-006-bx0002-020-002#?c=&m=&s=&cv=&xywh=-2767%2C-1%2C7733%2C3223">Walser</a>, pp. 7-9).  On March 1st, 1887, the bill to create an agricultural college through the Morrill Land Grant Act passed, and the process of creating the college was officially started.  Ground broke on August 22nd, 1888, and on October 3rd, 1889, the first 50 students were admitted to the college (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LD3928-L6-1939#?c=&m=&s=&cv=53&xywh=648%2C1273%2C8199%2C3417">Lockmiller</a>, pp. 34, 42; <a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/mc00229-006-bx0002-020-002#?c=&m=&s=&cv=&xywh=-2767%2C-1%2C7733%2C3223">Walser</a>, p. 14).</p>

<p>According to C. D. Harris, in a 1910 summary of NC A&ampM football, A&ampM opened too late in the 1889 season to organize a formal football schedule; instead, "two teams were organized among the students, and a rough-and-tumble game was played every Saturday."  The players' equipment was rudimentary, with uniforms being homemade and of differing colors, and shin guards made from soles of leather shoes (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v12n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=2&xywh=-2240%2C-1%2C8791%2C3664">Harris</a>, p. 174).  This crude start of football was not exactly unique to A&ampM.  In 1899, football as a sport was still in its infancy, especially in the South.  Informal games of football were being played on UNC's campus as early as 1878 (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/56302914/?terms=%22foot-ball%22%2Bfirst"><i>Observer</i>, February 18th, 1878</a>, p. 2), and grew more organized with time.  By 1883, UNC was organizing inter-class matches, and by 1888 students at Trinity (Duke), Wake Forest, and UNC had all organized teams.  The first recorded intercollegiate football game in North Carolina was played in Raleigh on October 18th, 1888.  Though a game had been scheduled for the Thanksgiving of 1887 between UNC and the Robert Bingham Academy, a boys' school based out of Asheville, NC, the game was eventually canceled.  A central advertising point of the 1888 State Fair, the inaugural game was played by Wake Forest and the University of North Carolina.  Played at the State Fair Grounds (which would later become home to NC A&ampM football), the match was played in the center of a horse racetrack and watched from baseball grandstands.  UNC's team, composed only of sophomores due to a miscommunication in planning, lost to Wake Forest's full school's team in a match where each team had fifteen men on the field and the rules "had elements of both rugby and soccer games."  Due to the unfamiliarity of each team with the rules, which were agreed upon just before the game started, the match was very sloppy, with the final score being 6-4 in favor of Wake Forest.  Despite this, the game was reported to be "the most interesting feature of the whole fair" and an overall success with the crowd (<a href="https://www-jstor-org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/stable/23518857?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents">Sumner</a>, p. 265).</p>

<p>Despite A&ampM starting intra-school games of football early, it would take another two years before intercollegiate football formally began at the college.  In his aforementioned history of NC A&ampM football, Harris claims that NC State had a team in 1890 that played numerous "prep" schools around the Raleigh area, in addition to Horner Military School, based out of Oxford, NC (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v12n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=2&xywh=-2240%2C-1%2C8791%2C3664">Harris</a>, p. 174).  Thad Mumau, among others, also claims the Farmers had what he called a club team from 1890-91 (<i>Go Wolfpack</i>, p. 27). This team was less a formal team of A&ampM and more a group of college-aged men from Raleigh who played football together.  Historian William Beezley describes this early team by writing that A&ampM's students "joined several young men from Raleigh in organizing an informal football team nominally representing the college" (<a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU423393">Beezley</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>Harris goes on to say that the team lost all those games and even failed to score for the entirety of the season, save the game against Horner.  The game, being played in Oxford, required A&Mâ€™s team to pay for the trip out of their own pockets.  Despite the cost of travel, the match proved to be a shining moment in an otherwise bleak season, with A&M coming out victorious.  The victory was celebrated with a "tremendous bonfire" where reportedly "all the members of the faculty" gave speeches "on that glorious victory."  Harris also claims A&ampM played a number of "prep" schools in the 1891 season, winning all but two.  He makes no specific mention of the game against Raleigh Male Academy, normally cited as NC State's first football game (<a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v12n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=2&xywh=-2240%2C-1%2C8791%2C3664">Harris, p. 174</a>).  The only other reference to football that early at NC State I have found (aside from an A&ampM student <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/64589055/?terms=%22A%26M%2Bcollege%22%2Bfoot-ball">breaking his collar bone</a> in February of 1890) is in <i>Touchdown Wolfpack</i>, where the author describes "organized intramural contests" and "informal games with the local prep schools" (<a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/record/NCSU950035">Douglas Herakovich</a>, p. 2).</p>

<!--
<p>This tradition of football teams mixed with college students and non-students was the same base that played the Spring 1892 game against the Raleigh Male Academy.  Beezley writes that "Besides calling on students for the squad, Whitaker recruited a center, a halfback, and coach Perrin Busbee from among Raleigh's young men to wear the pink and blue of A &amp M" (<a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU423393">Beezley</a>, p. 2).  A small correction to this would be that Whitaker was not a member of the 1891 A&ampM squad, but actually played for the Raleigh Male Academy as one of their star upperclassmen; Whitaker attended A&ampM the following year, and led the football team for his time at the school.  Reported to be a fullback, Busbee sat out of the only game of the year with an injury.  The only known player to return to the 1892 season's team was C. B. Williams, who was voted captain for A&ampM's second season.</p>

<p>Though I have not been able to find much about other members of the first formal football team of NC State, the members were picked carefully.  The issue was mainly logistical: A&ampM started as a military school, meaning all the students enrolled at the school had to do drill and training three times a week.  On top of class work, potential jobs, and a limited amount of light in the day, the men had limited time to train.  "Faculty [had] to excuse team members from drills during the season. For this reason the faculty carefully prescribed the number of players on a team, the length of the season, and regular attendance at practice" (<a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU423393">Beezley</a>, pp. 4-5).</p>

<p>The Spring 1892 game was the turning point of A&ampM football.  The game was the first game recognized and played under the purview (however minimal) of the university.  None of the earlier games had garnered any attention, and the Raleigh <i>News and Observer</i> didn't even assign a reporter to A&ampM's games until after the Raleigh Male Academy game (<a href="https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU423393">Beezley</a>, p. 3).  It also paved the way for a growing football program in the Fall of 1892.</p>
