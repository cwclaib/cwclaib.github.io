<p>Possibly the most highly-anticipated game of the 1908 season was the Farmers' season-closing tilt against their budding rival, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute Orange and Maroon.  The schools had met four times since the two agricultural schools first played in 1900, and the Gobblers had historically dominated, leading the series 4-0 with a cumulative score of 56-8.  The first meeting was back in 1900, when the Virginians won 18-2 at the North Carolina State Fair.  The biggest blowout was in 1903, when the Virginians took down A&ampM 21-0.</p>

<p>Tides were, however, changing in favor of A&ampM.  In 1904, when the VPI-A&ampM game was scheduled but then canceled, the game likely would have been fairly close, as both teams lost to Virginia 0-5; additionally, the Farmers tied North Carolina 6-6, while the Orange and Maroon lost 0-6.  When the two teams battled it out in a Thanksgiving Day matchup in Richmond Virginia just two seasons prior, the Aggies lost a long, closely-contested game on a trick play from VPI late in the second half.  So while the tides were changing in favor of the Red and White, they still had a bit of a chip on their shoulder.</p>

<p>Despite the closing talent gape between the two teams, the rivalry made sense in another, more significant way: both NC A&ampM and VPI had recently lost their primary rivals due to disputes.  A&ampM had not faced North Carolina since 1905, after repeated spates regarding the eligibility of A&ampM players fomented before a planned meeting in 1906.  Though UNC claimed that A&ampM standout "Babe" Wilson was ineligible, UNC fans bemoaned the debacle as yet another example of "the semi-annual wrangle that has preceded every athletic contest that Carolina has ever held with A. & M."  UNC's athletic committee sided with that consternation, agreeing to cease athletic relations "indefinitely"; the teams would not meet again until 1919.</p>

<p>Similarly, the rift between VPI and Virginia developed after the 1905 season for reasons of player eligibility.  The build-up to the seventh consecutive meeting between the two schools in 1905 was filled with consternation, as VPI had a player named Hunter Carpenter.  That year marked Carpenter's seventh season of college football, after spending five seasons in Blacksburg previously (three as an undergraduate, one as a graduate, and one as a faculty member) in addition to one season at North Carolina in 1904.  UVA's student paper, <i>College Topics</i>, relayed this iniquity to their students and added to the deal by alleging Carpenter was being paid as well, which resulted in Carpenter threatening to sue the paper for libel.  The college considered canceling the game, but eventually the entire student body rallied at Madison Hall to vote on the matter, where it was decided to go through with the game.  Virginia eventually lost the game 0-11; to add fuel to the fire, Carpenter was ejected after punching a UVA player.  The whole issue resulted in an indefinite suspension of the series; a suspension which lasted until 1923 (<a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/12/hoos-hokies-and-hatred-a-look-back-at-how-the-commonwealths-greatest-rivalry-began"><i>The Cavalier Daily</i>, December 11th, 2020</a>).</p>

<p>The city of Richmond had been anticipating the game for weeks; one writeup in Richmond's <i>Times-Dispatch</i> waxed at length about the "big, brawny and bony" men of "old pioneer settler" stock.  It then launched into a lengthy (though factually remiss)* article detailing A&ampM's rise from a "nonentity" to a real team, writing "they dream dreams down there, and they make some of their dreams come true" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/145490471/?terms=%22washington%20and%20lee%22%20football&match=6"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 16th, 1908</a>, p. 5).</p>

<p>On top of that, the Farmers had played a strong slate of games through this point in the season and had a respectable record of 5-1, with their single loss coming against a mulish and obstinate Virginia team who forbid two of A&ampM's stars, Von Glahn and Thompson, on technical details--a point which the previously-referenced article described a concerted effort by UNC and UVA to "manufacture eligibility rules for the A. and M."  Even discluding A&ampM's massive 76-0 blowout against Wake Forest, the Mechanics had a cumulative score on the year of 75-6, having only been scored upon by Virginia.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Blacksburg boys came into the game with a strong record.  On top of a 5-3 record, with wins over strong teams like Clemson (6-0), North Carolina (10-0) and the Virginia Military Institute (10-0), the only losses experienced by the Virginians through this point in the season were respectable losses to Princeton (4-10), eventual Southern Champion George Washington (0-6), and the Navy (4-15).</p>

<p>Note the teams both A&ampM and VPI had played: Virginia and North Carolina, respectively.  So each had a stake in the game larger than just the rivalry; if the Red and White won, that would mean they earned the title of Champion of North Carolina, whereas if the Orange and Maroon won, they earned the title of Champion of Virginia.  Both teams wanted to prove that they were superior to their snobby in-state rivals.</p>

<p>This game was to be the last for several mainstays of A&ampM's team.  Captain Stevens had been quarterback for two years and on A&ampM's team for three years, and was widely considered one of the team's top stars.  Though Von Glahn had only been on the varsity squad for two years, his formidable size (6'4", 200 lbs) and talent made him "the greatest lineman the south has produced since Louie Guion," long-time star and eventual captain who played at North Carolina from 1892-1895.  Stroud had, like Stevens, been on the football team for three years and at his current position (halfback) for two.  Thompson, captain during the 1907 season, was playing his third season at A&ampM after one season at Davidson.  Finally, star center John Bray was expected to graduate at the end of the season (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58216191/?terms=%22wake%20forest%22%20football&match=1"><i>The (Raleigh) Evening Times</i>, November 23rd, 1908</a>, p. 3; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/78458899/?terms=%22wake%20forest%22%20football&match=1"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 24th, 1908</a>, p. 5).</p>

<p>Papers claimed that "nearly the entire student body" of A&ampM planned to make the trip to Norfolk, in addition to the cadet band, 35-members strong<!-- https://www.newspapers.com/image/58216220/?terms=whitehurst&match=1 -->.  Perhaps a more distinguished North Carolinian, though, was also in Norfolk with the specific intention of watching the game: Governor R. B. Glenn.  After the game, the governor held a reception at Norfolk's Fairfax Hotel (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616501859/?terms=%22north%20carolina%22%20%22wake%20forest%22%20norfolk%20football&match=1#"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 23rd, 1908</a>, p. 8; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/145493325/?terms=football%2Bnorfolk"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 3).  The whole city shut down for the game, with "everything except the hotels" closed so that everyone who was able to could get to the game.</p>

<p>The stage was set for a great day of Thanksgiving football.  Both teams had a budding rivalry and something big to gain from a win.  With betting odds evenly split between the two teams in the days heading up to the game, the biggest football stage in the southeast--Lafayette Field--was set for an exciting day of football (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616501705/?terms=%22north%20carolina%22%20%22wake%20forest%22%20norfolk%20football&match=1"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 22nd, 1908</a>, p. 9; .</p>

<p>* Though filled largely with true statements, the article amalgamated highlights of several years into two, writing that A&ampM tied UNC 11-11 (1899) in one year and in the next beat St. Albans (1902) and gave VMI their first-ever home loss (1904, though it was actually their first home loss in 12 years) after tying Virginia 6-6.  The writer likely was intending to refer to the 1905-06 seasons, where A&ampM tied UNC 0-0 (1905) and then tied Virginia 0-0 and defeated VMI, but accidentally added a few spurious details.</p>

<p>The game was just as popular as expected, though just how depends wildly on the informant.  <i>News and Observer</i> (whose story was printed in abbreviated form in that day's <i>Charlotte News</i>) wrote that there were a 12,000 spectators in the crowd--a full two-thirds of which were North Carolinians.  Richmond's <i>Times-Dispatch</i>, on the other hand, approximated that 5,000 fans were in attendance, with loyalties split fairly evenly (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/145493453/"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 9).  The estimate in Baltimore's <i>Sun</i> gave no mention of divisions, but split the difference by guessing that 8,000 fans made it out for the game (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/372975879/?terms=norfolk%2Bnorth%2Bcarolina%2Bvirginia%2Bpolytechnic"><i>The (Baltimore) Sun</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 11).  <i>The Evening Times</i> concurred that 12,000 fans were in attendance, estimating that 8,000 of them were supporting A&ampM (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58216220/?terms=whitehurst&match=1"><i>The Raleigh Evening Times</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 2).  In addition to the crowd, roughly 300 A&ampM students showed out at the game, plus the entire A&ampM band.  The weather was reported to be "ideal" but "perhaps slightly warm for the best kind of football" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/78459043/?terms=norfolk"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 1).  Finally, the most conservative estimate came from the city itself, with Norfolk's <i>Virginian-Pilot</i> estimating just 4,000 fans in attendance (<a href="https://www.genealogybank.com/doc/newspapers/image/v2%3A146D908D09F2E7FE%40GB3NEWS-164B668F68A6E1BA%402418273-1649CEE7E9800B24%409-1649CEE7E9800B24%40?h=1&fname=&mname=&lname=&kwinc=football&kwexc=&rgfromDate=11/27/1908&rgtoDate=11/27/1908&formDate=&formDateFlex=exact&dateType=range&processingtime=&addedFrom=&addedTo=&sid=psudbysuyxqozmugaxbkwotpmhsrfzsx_wma-gateway008_1638716723175"><i>Virginian-Pilot</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 10).</p>

<p>The Aggies won the toss and chose to kick off.  Thompson kicked to VPI's 15-yard line; on two runs, VPI lost 5 yards, forcing them to punt the ball away.  "The mighty" Emory Hodgson punted the ball 50-60 yards, to just over midfield.  The Farmers lost 5 yards themselves and kicked, with Thompson reportedly making a "short kick" to Billups, who returned the ball 5 yards.  After a 1 yard run by Luttrell, the Orange and Maroon attempted "a short kick" of probably 30 yards, but the attempt was broken up.</p>

<p>Upon getting the ball on the touchback, A&ampM made two runs for 12 yards, but were then penalized 5 yards.  When the Farmers attempted to kick, Walker broke through A&ampM's line to "smear up" the kick.  The Techs made 3 yards before Emory punted the ball away, sending it 40 yards.  The ball got went over the head of Thompson, the returner, and was recovered by Hicks after either seven (<i>The Virginia Tech</i>), "less than ten" (<i>Virginian-Pilot</i>) or twenty (<i>News and Observer</i>) minutes of play.  The Orange and Maroon, sure of the touchdown, brought out E. R. Hodgson to kick the goal.  Here, "A. &amp M. kicked long and hard with the result" until the call was overturned to be a touchback, though the logic of this decision was not explained. <i>The Virginia Tech</i> was rather sore about this call, writing that the refs "showed [a] lack of judgment" in making this call.  Despite VPI's critique, however, at least one summary of the game specifically referenced the call changing owing to Coach Whitehurst having a copy of the rulebook with him (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58216220/?terms=whitehurst&match=1"><i>The Raleigh Evening Times</i>, NOvember 27th, 1908</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>After the play was decided to be a touchback, Thompson kicked from the requisite 25-yard line, sending the ball 30 yards away, to midfield.  After 11 yards on 4 plays by Connolly, V. B. "Bubbles" Hodgson, and "Joe," after which "Ole Hoss" E. R. Hodgson punted the ball 50 yards back upfield.  Here, accounts differ slightly: <i>The Virginia Tech</i> wrote that the Red and White kicked the ball back a paltry 20 yards; <i>News and Observer</i> wrote that the Farmers fumbled one of Hodgson's kicks, allowing VPI to recover it.  Either way, the Techs had the ball in excellent field position.  A forward pass from Emory to Connolly made 8 yards following a 5-yard run by Joe.  Runs for 5 and 2 yards by Connolly put the Orange and Maroon on A&ampM's 10-yard line.</p>

<p>Here, "Ole Hoss" Hodgson attempted a place kick goal (field goal).  All accounts of the game placed great emphasis on this kick; <i>News and Observer</i> set the scene well, writing "Everything is as still as can be"; as a result, "the suspense is so intense that the ball goes wild and V. P. I. loses another chance to score."  Of course, <i>The Virginia Tech</i> saw it another way, writing "Hodgson kicks what everyone thinks is a goal. No goal."  Elsewhere, they wrote that the kick went "directly over the uprights," adding that "The ball was just as much in as it was out," whatever that means.  "We recommend treatment for optics."</p>

<p>A&ampM got another touchback and performed another kick out, but two or three line plunges by A&ampM resulted in a turnover on downs, and both teams traded the ball back and forth at least once.  Hodgson attempted another goal from the field, but this one was blocked by Saddler, who then fell on the ball.</p>

<p>The description in <i>News and Observer</i> ends here, writing that the first half ended with the ball around midfield.  <i>The Virginia Tech</i>, on the other hand, described several advanced up the field by VPI but failed to explain any of A&ampM's playing.  After a series of Maroon and Orange drives (including long runs of 17 and 25 yards by Billups and Joe), the half ended with A&ampM on their own 15 yard line.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement between sources on how long the first half was. <i>The Sun</i> wrote that both halves were 35 minutes; the <i>N&ampO</i> wrote that the first half was 35 minutes and that the second one was just 30.  <i>The Times-Dispatch</i> and <i>The Virginia Tech</i> both agree that both halves were only 30 minutes.  Because of this combination of sources, I chose to document that the first half was 35 minutes and the second only 30, though access to a paper from Norfolk would likely help ascertain whether this is correct or not.</p>

<p>Though <i>The Virginia Tech</i> claimed that the "In the first half A. &amp M. was completely outmatched," more neutral sources wrote that the teams were evenly matched, adding that both teams attempted primarily the old style of play throughout the first half (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/145493453/"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 9).  Also notable is the fact that no other paper mentioned any of VPI's oft-cited complaints against the officiating, perhaps indicative of a more unbiased perspective on the game.  A final notable thing related to the halves and timing: the first documented half-time show performance by A&ampM's cadet band.**</p>

<p><blockquote>"Professors [Wallace Carl] Riddick and [Cliff Lewis] Newman, members of the A &amp M. [sic] board of trustees, C. W. Gold and Graduate Manager [Ceburn D.] Harris accompanied the band around the field between the halves. Pandemonium broke loose and everyone waved their banners and yelled when Dixie and Carolina were played. It was indeed a good natured and jolly crowd from down home."</blockquote></p>

<p>After a 15 minute break, the teams got back on the field and Emory kicked off for VPI, sending the ball to Stroud, who advanced the ball 15 yards to bring the start of A&ampM's first drive of the second half to their own 30-yard line.  After a near-equal gain and loss of yards, Thompson kicked off, sending the ball 40-60 yards, to roughly the Maroon and Orange 30-yard line.  Connolly returned the punt 10 yards, and on the next play Emory punted the ball 30 yards.</p>

<p>On a fake kick, A&ampM got either 5 or 15 yards (reports differ), and on the next play the Farmers attempted to advance the ball with a side kick; unfortunately, it ended up in the hands of "Peggy" for VPI.  On the subsequent drive, Joe, "Peggy" and Bubbles got 5 yards each using "her famous off tackle line plunges"; eventually, Emory punted, sending the ball 40 yards downfield.  Upon getting the balls, the Farmers were faced with quite a bit of hard luck: first, they lost 10 yards; they then "passed badly."  Evidently, Thompson recovered the kick and attempted to punt the ball away, however "about 20 players fall on Thompson before he can kick," giving the Techs control of the ball in excellent field position.</p>

<p>After a 2-yard run by Bubbles,  Emory made a 15-yard pass to Hicks on a fake kick to bring the Techs to A&ampM's 2-to-3-yard line.  On the next play, Hicks crossed the goal line, but VPI was penalized for being offside; this penalty was immediately offset after the Farmers were penalized similarly.  After two attempts by VPI players, Bubbles attempted to carry the ball across the goal line; he fumbled the ball, but it was recovered by Hicks to get the Gobblers the first touchdown of the game.  "Ole Hoss" Hodgson missed the goal kick after his attempted from a "mean angle" hit the upright; according to the November 28th edition of <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, it was his first miss of the year.  Reports in <i>Red and White</i> and <i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i> all concur that this touchdown took place after about 10-to-10-and-a-half minutes of play in the second half, while <i>Virginian-Pilot</i> claims it took place with just 10 minutes left to play (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616502333/?terms=norfolk%2B%22virginia%22%2B%22football%22"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 28th, 1908</a>, p. 3; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616502289/?terms=norfolk%2B%22virginia%22%2B%22football%22"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 8; <a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v10n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=8&xywh=-769%2C0%2C5953%2C3487"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. X No. 4 (December 1908)</a>, p. 179).  Upon scoring, the Virginians made "a magnificent demonstration" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/145493453/"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 9).</p>

<p>The Aggies kicked off to roughly VPI's 30-yard line, where "Burly" caught the kick and returned in 15 yards.  After a gain of 3 by Billups, Emory punted, sending the ball 40 yards downfield, to roughly A&ampM's 25-yard line.  A Red and White player started the drive with a run for no gain, but the Aggies followed that up with a fake kick for 8 yards of gain.  Sadly, Stevens lost 4 yards on two carries, resulting in a 30-yard punt by A&ampM to VPI's 45.  After a run for no gain by "Peggy," the Orange and Maroon punted again, sending the ball 40 yards, back to A&ampM's 25-yard line.  A&ampM booted the ball back to VPI, who sent a 40-yard punt back.</p>

<p>All reports agree that here the Farmers went to work.  Even <i>The Virginia Tech</i> consented that "A. &amp M. picked up wonderfully."  According to Charlotte's <i>Daily Observer</i>, "spectators say that such football as occurred in the next three minutes has never been seen in the South," writing that the entire A&ampM team worked as a cohesive unit to bring the ball down the field at a blinding speed (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616502333/?terms=norfolk%2B%22virginia%22%2B%22football%22"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 28th, 1908</a>, p. 3).  The account in <i>News and Observer</i> seems to skip the next few possessions which follow, which were described in <i>The Virginia Tech</i>.</p>

<p>Stephens caught VPI's 40-yard punt and ran it back 40-to-45 yards.  Through a series of "desperate... end runs, fake end runs, and line plunges," the Farmers advanced the ball to VPI's 20-yard line.  At some point in this series, A&ampM attempted a goal kick from field (field goal); Gibbs and Walker for VPI blocked the attempt, but the ball was recovered by A&ampM.  On first down with 10-to-15 yards to gain, the Farmers ran the ball twice without success.  On the third and final down, with 3 yards to go and about 5-7 minutes left to play, the Aggies decided to go for it.</p>

<p>Captain Stevens took requested a time out, at which point he changed out A&ampM's line, replacing Saddler at end with "Dutchy" Seifert, a speedy runner who was known more for  his ability to "move like greased lightning" rather than his blocking.  Additionally, Stevens swapped Spencer for Stroud and Floyd for Gattis "as a blind" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/616502333/?terms=norfolk%2B%22virginia%22%2B%22football%22"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, November 28th, 1908</a>, p. 3).  The Red and White made a fake quarterback run, Stevens threw a forward pass to "Dutchy," who, leaping from the 2-yard line, "rose up in the air," caught the ball, and went across the goal line, where he was tackled by "Griz," forcing A&ampM to attempt a punt-out play for the goal kick.  It was described as "the prettiest play of the game" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/372975879/?terms=norfolk%2Bnorth%2Bcarolina%2Bvirginia%2Bpolytechnic"><i>The (Baltimore) Sun</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 11).</p>

<p>Seifert's touchdown resulted in unprecedented joy among the Farmers; the band played and the fans yelled triumphantly.  "While little Seifert was being carried up the field on the shoulders of the A. &amp M. giants," the kick-out was performed.  Frank Thompson kicked the ball from the goal line towards the side line, where Seton was waiting to perform a fair catch way back at the 45-yard line.  Thompson then ran over to where Seton caught the ball; Stevens acted as a holder.</p>

<p>Here, the game was on the line, tied 5-5 with between five and seven minutes of play remaining, depending on the account.  "Amid a pandemonium of cheering, yells, and music," with the game on the line, Thompson made a perfect kick from 45 yards out, sending the ball right between the center of the goal post.  This kick put the Aggies put with a 6-5 lead; this was just the second time in series history that the Farmers had led the Gobblers.</p>

<p>The successful goal kick understandably upset Hodgson; as mentioned previously, it was his first miss of the year.  "Big Hodgson lay sobbing on the field under the stress of heartache and despair as if the final hope of happiness in this life had been snatched from him by Destinies."  Though the paper went on to allude that Hodgson blamed the loss on himself, it also pointed out that Hodgson "had done more than any three men on his team to carry the Tech. standard that far" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/58216220/?terms=whitehurst&match=1"><i>The Raleigh Evening Times</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>No account of the game bothered describing the last few minutes in any great detail.  Both teams exchange the punt several times with a series of unsuccessful runs scattered in between, but otherwise, nothing much of substance took place, with neither team ever even having the opportunity to score.  The game ended with the ball in VPI's possession at the 40-yard line (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/78459043/?terms=norfolk"><i>News and Observer</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 1; <i>The Virginia Tech</i>, Vol. VI No. 11 (December 2nd, 1908)</a>, pp. 1, 3).</p>

<p>VPI was, as referenced earlier, livid about the officiating of the game.  One of the subtitles to their student paper's game summary was "REFEREE WAS OF VERSATILE MIND" and noted in the first sentence of the writeup that the game was "spectacular" but "marred by some A. &amp M. kicks against decision." To be fair, the crew was not all the star-level refs who were present for the Virginia game.  Wake Forest's coach A. P. Hall, Jr., served as umpire, while a V. C. Chase* of the University of Michigan was the referee.  The head linesman, however, T. M. West, of Dickinson, was a prominent official from Baltimore who had helped officiate several major games starting in the second half of the decade.</p>

<p>Richmond's <i>Times-Dispatch</i> reported on a more serious disagreement as a result of the game, claiming that the two teams severed athletic relations as a result of the game.  The article reported that both institutions had signed an agreement eschewing the use of professional players; this was problematic due to Frank Thompson's previously-mentioned play in a summer baseball league.  According to the article, Professor Riddick informed VPI's management that the Farmers would refuse to play unless Thompson was allowed to play.  As such, the article wrote, "it was agreed that the game be played here this afternoon... only with the understanding that athletic relations between the two institutions would hereafter be at an end."  However, given the fact that no other paper mentioned the incident, especially the bellicose sports editor of <i>The Virginia Tech</i>, the paper seems to have blown the misunderstanding out of proportion (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/145493453/"><i>The (Richmond) Times-Dispatch</i>, November 27th, 1908</a>, p. 9).</p>

<p>For the Techs, the stars of the game were reported to be E. R. Hodgson, for his punting, as well as Luttrell, Hicks, and Walker.  For A&ampM, the best work was done by Thompson ("his best this year"), Stevens ("the best in the South"), Van Glahn, and Saddler <i>The Virginia Tech</i>, Vol. VI No. 11 (December 2nd, 1908)</a>, pp. 1, 3; <a href="https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/LH1-N6-R4-v10n4#?c=&m=&s=&cv=8&xywh=-769%2C0%2C5953%2C3487"><i>Red and White</i>, Vol. X No. 4 (December 1908)</a>, p. 179).</p>

<p>Following their victory, the Farmers were warmly congratulated by Governor Glenn on Lafayette Field, who claimed their victory made him "prouder than ever" to be a North Carolinian.  After that, the team received a "jubilee concert" by the cadet band in front of their hotel, The Fairfax.  Upon returning to Raleigh, the team was given box seats at the Raleigh Opera House to see a production of <i>The Boys of Company B</i>, featuring popular actor Paul Gilmore.

<p>* Just who V. C. Chase was has not been ascertained; the only prominent Chase associated with Michigan football before 1908 was Gen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chase_(general)">John "Tubby" Chase</a>, who was a player on Michigan's team in 1880; Gen. Chase was employed with the army in Colorado throughout the early 20th Century, making his being the Chase identified unlikely.</p>

<p>** The earliest known date the band played during intermission was on Thanksgiving Day of 1906, against Virginia Tech, but the report does not indicate taking the field.  This game is the first recorded time the band took the field, performing any semblance of a halftime show.</p>
