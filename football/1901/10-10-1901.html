<p>Much like the year before, after meeting with Guilford at the Central Carolinas Fair, the Farmers made the short trip to Oak Ridge to meet the Cadets in a game of football.  In 1900, A&ampM had won their game at Oak Ridge 17-5, but the victory was nullified due to the use of a player who did not meet the NC Athletic Association's eligibility rules.  The second time the teams met, in Raleigh, the Farmers won 21-0, even without the player who had been ruled against.  Needless to say, after beating the Guilford team that had twice defeated the Red and White the previous year, the A&ampM team was confident of a victory heading in to the game.</p>

<p>Oak Ridge had, however, the guidance of a coach.  Under the training of J. T. Bennett, a former Oak Ridge student and local baseball player originally from Nebraska, Bennett had been coaching since at least 1899 in one form or another (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/61987231/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2Bhome%2Bfootball"><i>The Greensboro Patriot</i>, September 4th, 1901</a>, p. 9). <!-- sources: https://www.newspapers.com/image/64210494/?terms=%22J.%2BT.%2BBennett%22%2Bnebraska%2Bbaseball, https://www.newspapers.com/image/66990497/?terms=%22J.%2BT.%2BBennett%22, https://www.newspapers.com/image/76576906/?terms=%22J.%2BT.%2BBennett%22%2Bbaseball, https://www.newspapers.com/image/62299675/?terms=%22J.%2BT.%2BBennett%22%2Bnebraska%2Bbaseball --> </p>

<p>Much like the Guilford game, not many details of the game survive.  The <i>Patriot</i> wrote that the game was "hard fought."  The best surviving summary of the game from the <i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>.  The <i>Observer</i> wrote that A&ampM, "fresh from defeating Guilford College... by a decided score, came to Oak Ridge yesterday expecting to get to get [a] more decided victory, but had to content themselves with less than half the points they had won the day before."  The 40 minute game resulted in two touchdowns but no goals for a total of 10 points.  The Farmers got one touchdown in each of the two 20-minute halves.  Both teams showed expected signs of "rawness" and lack of training, but the Blue and Red's defensive line was described as a "stonewall."</p>

<p>A&ampM's team was described as "splendid," and Coach McRae's training was also praised.  There was, however, some contention in the game: the left halfback, Richardson, had reportedly played for UNC's team the previous year and had not waited a year after transferring colleges.  After the first touchdown, Richardson was forced to sit out for the rest of the game.  Despite that, "The A. &amp M. boys are generally a very genteel lot and left a very good impression for themselves" (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/61987303/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2B%22A%2B%26%2BM%22%2Bgreensboro%2Bfootball"><i>The Greensboro Patriot</i>, October 16th, 1901</a>, p. 9; <a href="https://infoweb-newsbank-com.proxy141.nclive.org/apps/news/document-view?p=AMNEWS&t=pubname%3A11260DC9BB798E30%21Charlotte%2BObserver/year%3A1901%211901&sort=YMD_date%3AD&fld-base-0=alltext&maxresults=20&val-base-0=%22A%20%26%20M%22%20manager%20team&docref=image/v2%3A11260DC9BB798E30%40EANX-NB-1128C264C4F65708%402415670-1128C266C70F4FE0%407-1128C26C8EE63580%40A.%2Band%2BM.%2BGets%2BTwo%2BTouchdowns.%2BBut%2BHer%2BEleven%2BFailed%2Bto%2BKick%2BGoal%2BEach%2BTime%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGame%2Bwith%2BOak%2BRidge"><i>Charlotte Daily Observer</i>, October 12th, 1901</a>, p. 8).</p>

<p>After celebrating the victory over Guilford the previous night, the A&ampM students were ecstatic over a second straight victory for their team, especially after the rough season the year before.  The team was met at the train station by "the entire battalion" in addition to A&ampM College's President, Dr. Winston.  The cadets "gave the regular military honors of presenting arms and escorting them back to the college."  A dress parade was given, and the students marched up Dawson Street to Hillsboro Street, where they were met by the recently-formed band (<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/56300327/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2B10"><i>The (Raleigh) Morning Post</i>, October 12th, 1901</a>, p. 5; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75883302/?terms=%22oak%2Bridge%22%2B10"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 12th, 1901</a>, p. 2; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/75883310/?terms=guilford"><i>News and Observer</i>, October 13th, 1901</a>, p. 2).</p>

<p>Oak Ridge would go on to have a stellar season other than their losses to A&ampM and UNC, which would take place the following Saturday.  After losing 0-28 to UNC, Oak Ridge went on to defeat Madison High School on October 26th 49-0 (even after Madison put in their coach after 5 minutes of play), and the William Bingham School of Mebane, NC on November 2nd 22-0.  The Oak Ridge team then went West to face another school who had been making waves in the football world of the 1900s: the Robert Bingham School of Asheville, NC.  The Robert Bingham School had played the University of South Carolina twice in 1899, defeating them once, and narrowly lost to the Fighting Gamecocks in 1901 by a score of 11-6.  The Robert Bingham School also defeated Wofford earlier in the 1901 season 24-6.  While out in the western part of the state, the Oak Ridge cadets deafeated the Morganton School for the Deaf 16-11 on November 21st.  The following day, Oak Ridge narrowly defeated the Robert Bingham School 6-0, and the day after that, Oak Ridge defeated the Asheville School 5-0, playing with only 10 men throughout the game because "one of their players would not enter the game."  Oak Ridge finished the season 5-2 and the clear leader of prep schools in North Carolina.</p>
