<p>Because of the scaricity of easily available data on the Coaches' Poll from its inception in 1950 through 1976, I decided to assemble information on the extant polls.  I probably won't bother formatting it much, if at all, because it's for reference purposes only.</p>

<p>If there is an entry without a newspapers.com clipping next to it, it is from <i>ESPN College Football Encyclopedia</i>, Ed. Michael MacCambridge (2005).  There may be some minor mistakes with these references (for example, in the 1953 season, <i>ESPN</i> fails to list the September 29th UP poll in its entireity, and mistakenly noted Utah as ranked 19th in the AP rather than the UP on October 5th despite Utah never once entering the rankings in the AP that season), however they are by-and-large correct.</p>
