<p>Because of the scaricity of easily available data on the United Press International (UPI) Coaches' Poll from its inception in 1950 through 1976, I decided to assemble information on the extant polls.  These are initially based off of <i>ESPN College Football Encyclopedia</i>, Ed. Michael MacCambridge (2005), but supplemented and corrected with historical newspapers.  As I was assembling the initial lists, I realized the data was incomplete: for starters, since the ESPN book was based off of the AP Poll, only the top 10 UPI teams maximum were listed in the UPI poll from 1961-1967 (when the AP ranked only 10 teams) rather than the 20 team format the UPI used from 1950 until the 1990s.  Additionaly, the ESPN list failed to include first place votes, and had a few minor but obvious transcription errors.  Sometimes, even the published newspapers had a few errors in printing; I've done my best to make an educated guess and correct the errors as needed, but it still may not be perfect.</p>

<p>Unless there's a significant interest in doing so, I probably won't bother formatting these lists any more than they are already, if at all, because they're just for my reference only.</p>
