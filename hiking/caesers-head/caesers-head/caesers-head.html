	<h2>Overlook - Caesers Head State Park (South Carolina)</h2>
</center>

<p>Visited on Monday, July 5th, 2021 with my brother and a friend.</p>

<p>An overlook along US 276, just over the South Carolina border.</p>

<p>Though there are a number of trails in this area (which connects to the Mountain Bridge Wilderness Area), I have yet to do any of them besides the short trail system directly at the overlook, which gives views of the overlook (seen below), as well as the rock formation known as The Devil's Kitchen.  While an alluring name, the formation itself is sadly not very photogenic and is something that has to be seen in person to be appreciated, though it is fun to climb through and around.</p>

<p>The Devil's Kitchen got its name from locals, who wagered that there was only way the unique, deep-yet-narrow crack in the vacinity could have been formed: the devil, while making a brew of whiskey, spilled a drop so hot it caused the rock to split right in two.</p>

<p>Sadly, it is not known exactly how Caesers Head got its name; the most popular of three known theories is that a hunting dog named Caeser fell off the cliff while chasing some prey--though if this were the case, the area would more properly be referred to as Caesers Defeat.  A second theory states that it is derived from the Cherokee word for chief, <i>sachem</i>.  A final theory is that the outcropping itself resembles Julius Caeser; this one is understandably the most dubious.</p>
