	<h2>Stack Rock Parking Area and Trail - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>Visited on Sunday, November 8th, 2020.</p>

<p>A short (&lt;1 mile) trail along the Blue Ridge Parkway (near Grandfather Mountain) located at mile marker 305.2.</p>

<p>I did not thoroughly explore this trail as I was trying to find a good place to watch the sunset; however, the shoulder of the road near the parking area was a great place to watch the sky change colors.</p>
