	<h2>Green Knob Firetower - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on the morning of October 16th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Unfortunately, access to the top of the firetower has been blocked off, but I climbed the stairs as far as I could go to see what kind of view I could get.</p>

<p>We hit this stop just before the weather soured on us; in fact, as I was at the top of the tower's stairs, the wind started swirling around us, and made me seriously reconsider whether climbing up had been a good idea!</p>

<p>Before climbing the firetower, we also appreciated the view from the associated overlook.  The first pictures in this album are from there, though because the rising sun blinded any and all attempts to get pictures of the overlook itself, they are all of the impressive tree located at the center of the parking area and the road to the start of the trail.</p>
