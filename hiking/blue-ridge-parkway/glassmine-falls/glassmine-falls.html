	<h2>Glassmine Falls View - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on October 16th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway, including this beautiful vista.  There was some powerful wind while we were here that stole the hat of a man taking in the view with us.</p>
