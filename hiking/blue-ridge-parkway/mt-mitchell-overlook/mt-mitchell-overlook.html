	<h2>Mt. Mitchell Overlook - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on October 16th and 17th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  While the weather at the overlook had been nice on the first day, the weather at Mt. Mitchell had been overcast and rainy; since we had time, we decided to give the area second shot the following morning.  While Mt. Mitchell itself was no better the second day than the day before, this overlook of the mountain turned out well both days.</p>
