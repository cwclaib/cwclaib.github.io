	<h2>Hawkbill Rock - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on October 16th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway, including this wet attempted hike to Hawkskill Rock and Snowball Mountain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, dense fog, a driving rain, and strong winds prohibited us from getting very far along the trail.  I stubbornly had us hike about a mile before conceding defeat to the weather, as the wind had been gusting harder and harder throughout the hike.</p>
