	<h2>Little Bald Overlook - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I walked this area on Saturday, March 8th, 2025.  My wife and I had originally intended to do a sunset hike nearby, but discovered the southern portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway which housed our hike was closed to vehicle and foot traffic due to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.  Fortunately, though the northern section was gated, it did not contain a similar message, so we hiked the roughly 3/4-mile journey to the overlook.  We also walked a little father to the Grandmother Parking Area.</p>
