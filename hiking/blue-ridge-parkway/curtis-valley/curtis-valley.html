	<h2>Curtis Valley Overlook - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on the morning of October 17th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  We woke up extra early this particular morning hoping to catch a few good pictures of the sunrise.</p>

<p>Note that as of this writing (Feb. 2022) this overlook is not located where Google Maps places the overlook, but is instead located where Google Maps says the Laurel Knob Overlook is located; the overlook in what Google Maps identifies as the Curtis Valley Ovelrook is, to my knowledge, unnamed.</p>
