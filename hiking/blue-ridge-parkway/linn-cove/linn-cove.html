<p>Visitied on Saturday, June 29th, 2019.</p>

<p>This overlook along the Blue Ridge Parkway has a short nature trail which gives you access to several rocky outcroppings along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  This hike requires a good bit of bouldering but is manageable for most hikers and lots of fun.</p>

<p>From the Linn Cove Parking Lot, find the trail for the observation deck; this should be towards the western corner of the lot.  From there, you can follow the Tanawha Trail, which in this section is paved.</p>

<p>You should be walking right underneath the Viaduct itself.</p>

<p>After hiking for maybe a quarter of a mile or less, follow a rock outcropping off the trail.  You can follow a few side trails to get a nice closer look at the road.

Once you've done that, you'll have access to some great views of the Viaduct from some of the rocks along the side of the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>

<p>You should be able to tell where the official trail ends and the bouldering begins.

<p>According to one of my friends, if you keep following the rock outcroppings you can eventually reach Grandfather Mountain; I didn't do that when I was hiking, but I fully believe it's possible.</p>
