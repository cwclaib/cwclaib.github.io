	<h2>Laurel Knob Overlook - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on October 16th and 17th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  The morning had been marred by a spate of bad weather, so imagine our surprise when we crested a hill and saw a stunning double rainbow peaking out through the clouds!</p>

<p>This stop was originally known as Licklog Ridge Overlook, and is still sometimes referred to as such in a great deal of literature on the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>

<p>Note that as of this writing (Feb. 2022) this overlook is not located where Google Maps places the overlook, northeast of the Green Knob Overlook, but is instead just southwest of the intersection of the parkway and Toe River Road.</p>
