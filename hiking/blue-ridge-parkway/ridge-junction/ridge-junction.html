	<h2>Ridge Junction Overlook - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on October 16th and 17th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway, including this beautiful vista.  It was a light in a dark time -- literally.  Both times I stopped here were directly around fruitless trips to a foggy Mt. Mitchell.</p>
