	<h2>Mount Mitchell State Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on October 16th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway, including a hapless visit to the highest peak east of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fog and drizzling conditions prevailed all morning; though we waited out the fog for nearly half an hour, and drove to the upper parking lot twice, the fog never cleared.  Instead, we did a short nature loop near the top of the peak and agreed we would have to return at a later date.  Hopefully the picture and video below will show you that sometimes words truly can describe some views.</p>
