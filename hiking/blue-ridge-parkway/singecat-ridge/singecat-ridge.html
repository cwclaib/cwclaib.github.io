	<h2>Singecat Ridge Overlook - Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this view on the morning of October 16th, 2021 with my girlfriend.  While the main objective of the trip had been to drive the unpaved section of NC 197 between Burnsville and Barnardsville, we camped near and hiked several trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  We woke up extra early this particular morning hoping to catch a few good pictures of the sunrise.</p>
