	<h2>Goldmine Loop - Great Smoky Mountains National Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this trail on February 27th, 2021 with my parents, brother, and two dogs.</p>

<p>Drive up from Bryson City NC down Everett Street.  Eventually, the road will become Laveiew Drive.  After about 8 miles of driving, you reach The Tunnel To Nowhere.</p>

<p>After walking through the tunnel, you can turn down the Goldmine Loop Trail.  Unfortunately, the marking and signage is not great, though the trails are always clear enough.</p>

<p>Though the start is pretty smooth, after a bit of time you take a fairly steep downhill descent; then, you follow a small mountain stream through a nice section of forest.  Plenty of mountain laurel, as you can see in this picture.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several sections of the trail were also in a semi-permanent bog state.  Thankfully someone had placed some wood over most of them, but it wasn't always quite enough.</p>

<p>After about a mile and a half of hiking, you reach a cove which holds Fontana Lake.  You can see pictures <a href="http://www.hikinginthesmokys.com/goldmine-loop.htm">online</a> of what the cove looks like when the water is up, but when we were there the water was pretty low.
