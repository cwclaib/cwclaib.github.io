	<h2>Purchase Knob - Great Smoky Mountains National Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on Sunday, December 20th, 2020 with my parents, brother, and our two dogs.</p>

<p>To get to Purchase Knob, take US 19 towards Dellwood and then exit onto US-276 N.  Follow 276 for 2.4 miles before turning left onto Hemphill Road (NC 1318); follow Hemphill Rd. for about 5 miles until you come upon a metal gate and a small parking area.  Park here and get out of your car to start the hike.  Note that the gate may (though is often not) open; if you drive into the park, there is a risk your car will get locked in.</p>

<p>This trail starts along a gravel road which intersects with Jonathan Creek; unfortunately, though, the drop-off is so steep it doesn't offer great views of the water.</p>

<p>After hiking on this road for about 1-1/4 miles, you'll come upon some actual foot trails

<p>Hiking up the hill, you're met with a fork in the trail.  Going let takes you to an old homestead (the Ferguson Cabin), Rock Hop Creek, and eventually to McKee Branch Trail and Cataloochee Valley; sadly, my family didn't have time to make the trip there, as it was getting dark.  Going to the right takes you up to the Appalachian Highlands Science Learning Center, which was unfortunately closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, via Meadow Trail.  Ordinarily, though, the Center is open and serves as an excellent way to learn more about local wildlife.</p>

<p>Hiking about a half- to a quarter-of-a-mile up the incline brings you to the hill upon which the Learning Center sits.</p>

<p>The views from the top of the hill offer an excellent mountain meadow scene and a great view of the surrounding Smoky Mountains, and of Purchase Knob itself (not pictured below), which my family ironically mistakenly failed to ascend.</p>
