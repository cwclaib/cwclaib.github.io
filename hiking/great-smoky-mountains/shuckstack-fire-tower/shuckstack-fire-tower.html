	<h2>Shuckstack Fire Tower - Great Smoky Mountains</h2>
</center>

<p>I completed this hike on 5/3/2023 with my brother and my mom.</p>

<p>Shuckstack Fire Tower is located deep in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains, with the shortest route in being a 7-mile sojourn down the Appalachian Trail, featuring a wicked 2,000+ feet of elevation gain, not including the ascent of the tower.  The hike starts steep, and stays that way for a rather long time.  Most of the first two miles are at a serious grade, with a few switchbacks thrown in out of necessity.  As you hike, you may get occasional glimpses of Fontana Lake, which the parking for this hike is located just off of.</p>

<p>After about 3 miles of hiking, you'll be rewarded to your first clear view of the near-pristine forestland through which you're hiking with an ocher-speckled outcropping.  After one final (steep!) hurrah, you'll reach the point where the trail to the fire tower branches off.  After less than a quarter mile of hiking, you'll come upon the base of the fire tower; this area also features the remnants of the cabin the watchmen stayed in while this tower was actively used.</p>

<p>Though the tower is a bit old and worn down, it's pretty solidly constructed, and other than some bendy boards at the top, it's totally safe to climb up as of the time of this writing.  From the top, you can get some awe-inspiring views of Fontana Lake, the Smoky Mountains, and other natural wonders from a nearly one-of-a-kind vantage point.</p>
