	<h2>Pretty Hollow Creek Trail - Great Smoky Mountains</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this easy and scenic hike in the Smoky Mountains' Cataloochee Valley area on August 20th, 2022 with my parents and my girlfriend.</p>

<p>The trailhead for this hike can be found at a bridge located just over 12-3/4 miles from the I-40/US-276 interchange.  Follow Cove Creek Rd (SR 1395) for 7-1/2 miles before turning left on Ranger Station/Cataloochee Entrance Rd.  After another 5-1/4 miles of driving, the parking area will be on your right, just past one of the parks' vault toilets.</p>

<p>The trail follows the nearby Palmer Creek closely for the duration of the hike, of which we did about 2.  The trail follows a wide gravel path through a lush and scenic forest</p>

<p>This area, known for its elk sightings, did not disappoint us: we saw three over the course of our hike.  Unfortunately, they were all centered around the least attractive part of the trail, a backcountry horse camp.</p>

<p>After hiking for a couple miles, we stopped at a rocky outcropping along the river to have a quick lunch.</p>

<p>We also got to see several historic buildings in the area. Very close to the trailhead of this hike was the Beech School, which was built in 1903.</p>

<p>Later that day, we visited the <a href="../rough-fork/rough-fork.html">Rough Fork Trail</a> and a few other historic buildings in the area, including the Caldwell House and the Woody Place.</p>
