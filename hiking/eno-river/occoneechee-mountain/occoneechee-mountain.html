	<h2>Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area</h2>
</center>

<p>* The Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area is managed by the Eno River State Park.

<p>I visited the this natural area near Hillsborough, North Carolina on March 6th, 2021, with two friends.  One of the two was a recently-met roommate from Switzerland who wanted to see the mountains of North Carolina; while this is obviously not the biggest or most impressive that comes to mind, we only wanted to do a short day trip, so we visited somewhere I had never been either!</p>

<p>We hiked more or less all of the trails in the Natural Area.</p>
