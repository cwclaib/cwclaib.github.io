	<h2>Cox Mountain Trail - Eno River State Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trip on April 1st, 2022 with my girlfriend.  The hike starts with a short paved section which then quickly moves to a well-worn dirt path; you then take some stairs upwards.</p>

<p>After the ascension, you then head back down for a short walk along the Eno River.  While there, I saw a turtle who seemed to be stuck on a rock.  Fortunately, when we came back at the end of the hike, he seemed to have found his way off.</p>

<p>After a short walk along the river, you take a bridge to cross the river.  We also took a short detour to see an older cabin along the trail, which was also along the bank of the river.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find a name for or any history of this cabin.</p>

<p>After that, you leave the creek for a while, until you've summited Cox Mountain.</p>

<p>Eventually, the trail reconnoiters with the river.  After some time along here, you'll reach a spot with lots of rocks that make for some excellent rock hopping.</p>
