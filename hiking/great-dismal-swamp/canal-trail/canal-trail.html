	<h2>Canal Trail and Supplejack Trail - Great Dismal Swamp State Park</h2>
</center>

<p>Visited on Sunday, January 29th, 2023 with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>We did this short but interesting loop at Great Dismal Swamp State Park early in the morning.  We started going down Canal Trail, where a man and his very friendly dogs greeted us.  On the canal trail, we saw some neat signs about moonshining in the swamps and the history of light boats and their importance to the swamp.</p>

<p>From there, we turned onto Supplejack Trail (also seen sometimes as Supple Jack or Supple-Jack), which was a narrower and more shut-in style of trail.</p>
