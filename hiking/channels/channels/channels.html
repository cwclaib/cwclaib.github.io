	<h2>The Channels (Virginia)</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this hike on Thursday, May 12th, 2022 with my brother.  Because it was around noon on a weekday, we didn't see many other people -- maybe 3 other groups.</p>

<p>A lot of the hike is some fairly unremarkable gravel road, though occasionally some vistas do break through.</p>

<p>After a few miles of hiking, you reach the top of the mountain and the abandoned fire watch tower.  Near there is also a little preview to the channels to come.</p>

<p>After walking under the fire tower, you have basically reached the Channels, which are a really unique and interesting rock formation.  They're basically slot canyons in the middle of the mountains.</p>
