	<h2>Mingo Falls - Eastern Cherokee Nation</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on October 24th, 2020.  I technically hiked it once before that some time in 2016 but have lost all the pictures.</p>

<p>Mingo Falls is located in the northern side of the Eastern Cherokee Nation in western North Carolina, very close to the boundary of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  If you're coming from the east, take US-19 "south" (in reality the highway travels westward) until you hit US-441 North.  After that, take the first right on Drama Rd and then take the third exit on the traffic cirle, for NC-1368 (Acquoni Road).  After a mile, turn right on NC-1410 (Big Cove Road) and follow that road as it winds by the Occonaluftee River for 5.2 miles.  Then, turn right onto Sherill Cove Road and you should be at Mingo Falls Campground and the parking area for the hike.</p>

<p>The hike itself (on Pigeon Creek Trail) is not terribly difficult; it starts out rather steep on a section of stairs built into the trail, but levels off after not too long and becomes a more manageable incline.  After that, follow the gravel trail for about a quarter of a mile until you reach a wooden bridge that sits at the base of the falls.</p>
