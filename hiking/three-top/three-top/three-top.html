	<h2>Three Top Mountain Game Lands - Three Top Summit Trail</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on Sunday, May 15th 2022 with my brother.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we started the hike later in the day than we had wanted to after visiting a friend in Damascus.  We wanted to get to the top for the sunset, which made us really rush to get to the top.  Because of how late we started, we were the only people in the parking area, though we heard the gunshots of hunters which attested to other people being in the game lands.</p>

<p>The hike is one of the steepest and most unforgiving I've done since <a href="../nantahalah/pinnacle-park/pinnacle-park.html">Pinnacle Park Trail</a> -- a very steep, gravel-covered trail which scarcely used a switchback.  It basically went straight up.  The fourth picture down is facing directly forward to attest to the incline.</p>

<p>The blistering pace we set to reach the top in time didn't lend itself to taking many pictures of the trail, though we did get a few cool sights in, especially some very impressive large rocks.</p>

<p>Reaching the summit, though, was definitely worth it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some rapidly-forming thunderstorms drove us down from the top before the sunset, and at a rather rapid pace: we were literally running back down the trail for most of it.  Thankfully, during the drive back, we had a moment to catch a good view of the sunset, which you can see in the Ashe County section of the <a href="../non-parks/driving/driving.html">driving scenery</a> page.
