	<h2>Big Bend Falls Trail - Sumter National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on September 10th, 2021 by myself.</p>

<p>I did this hike on the way to Starkville, Mississippi to watch the NC State-Mississippi State football game.  I just saw the trail along the side of the road and had a little extra time, so I stopped in with little preparation and no knowledge of where the hike actually went, so I never quite reached the falls.  There were also a number of State Park vehicles parked about a mile up up the road, which made me feel like I shouldn't be there!  Ironically, I turned around after going about 2 miles, just about 3/4 miles short of reaching the falls.</p>
