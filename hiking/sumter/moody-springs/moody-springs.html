	<h2>Moody Springs - Sumter National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on September 10th, 2021 by myself.</p>

<p>I did this hike on the way to Starkville, Mississippi to watch the NC State-Mississippi State football game.  I saw both stops along the side of SC 107 and figured I'd check them out since I had the time.  There was a short, informal trail behind Moody Springs; after trying some of the spring water, I checked it out, but didn't feel anything was worth taking pictures of.</p>
