	<h2>Backbone Rock Trail - Cherokee National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this trail on Sunday, July 25th, 2021 with one other person.</p>

<p>This 4.5 mile trail is located just outside of Laurel Bloomery, Tennesee.  As attested by the numerous signs around the area, Google Maps often leads people astray, so be sure to follow your directions while getting to the trailhead.  First of all, if you are Google Mapping your way to the trail, make sure to include "Trailhead" in the title; otherwise, you'll be dumped at someone's driveway.  Starting from Laurel Bloomery, turn off TN 91 and onto Gentry Creek Rd; turn right and then left to stay on this road, then follow the gravel road all the way to the parking area--DO NOT turn on Pete Greever Rd, like Google Maps recommends.</p>

<p>Be sure to use a vehicle with good clearance; the gravel road to the parking area is in pretty rough shape.</p>

<p>The trail starts off through a thick section of laurel and soon starts following Gentry Creek fairly closely.  And by closely, I mean you'll have to make about 20 water crossings.</p>

<p>After some time hiking (I did not note the distance), you'll come across two small waterfalls.</p>

<p>After a bit more hiking and scaling of some rocky sections, you'll finally reach Gentry Creek Falls.</p>
