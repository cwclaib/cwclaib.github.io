	<h2>Backbone Falls Trail - Cherokee National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this trail on July 25th, 2021 with one other person.</p>

<p>This first picture is technically from Backbone Rock Campground and not from any of the nearby hikes.</p>

<p>After ascending a staircase at the base of the parking area, we were met by the old stone wall shown below.  It was probably built in the 1930s, alongside much of the other stonework in the area, as part of a depression-era WPA project.  On the other side of the wall were a few hooks for climbing.  The second picture is a shorter set of stairs we saw but a good representative of the stairs in the area.</p>

<p>After just over maybe a tenth of a mile of hiking, we crossed over the top of the falls and then descended down another staircase towards the base of the falls.

<p>We initially were planning on following the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/backbone-falls-trail">AllTrails</a> recommended route, however when we arrived at the parking area the map didn't seem to line up with what we saw and thought made logical sense.  Instead, look for a standard brown trail marker labeled Trail 198: Back Bone Falls.  A map is, in my opinion, not necessary.</p>
