	<h2>Nantahalah National Forest - Whitewater Falls</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on September 10th, 2021 by myself.</p>

<p>I did this hike on the way to Starkville, Mississippi to watch the NC State-Mississippi State football game.  While eating leftover barbecue from Red Bridge's in Shelby in the Burrel's Ford parking area, two seperate groups (an elderly man originally from New Jersey but living now in Pickens, SC, and a couple from Tacoa, Georgia) recommended I check out Whitewater Falls while in the area.  Since I had the time, I went ahead and checked it out, and while there wasn't much hiking to do, it was certainly beautiful.</p>
