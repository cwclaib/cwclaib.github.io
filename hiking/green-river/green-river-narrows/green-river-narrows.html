	<h2>Green River Narrows - Green River Game Lands</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on Tuesday, June 8th, 2021 with my brother.</p>

<p>The trailhead for this trail is called the Pulliam Creek Trailhead, and can be found off SR 1802, Big Hungry Road.  This road can be accessed off of Henderson's Upward Rd, SR 1722.  After turning onto Big Hungry Road, drive 4.4 miles until you come upon an obvious parking area of gravel; there should be a small wooden footbridge near a telephone pole visibile from the road.</p>

<p>Follow this trail (the Pulliam Creek Trail); this is the trail you'll be on for most of the hike.  You'll go through a nice wooded area and get some good views of Pulliam Creek.</p>

<p>After following the trail for 1.2 miles, you'll come across a fairly substantial bend in the trail with two identifiable trees leaning sharply to the side.  The dirt around this area should be pretty worn down, making the turn obvious.  Turn right down this ravine and follow the pink ribbons and rope system downward.  Be careful--this section is very sleep and slippery!</p>

<p>Following the trail downward, you'll get your first good views of the trail at about the halfway point.  Then, you'll get to a truly slippery section of rocks that get a good splattering of water from a small nearby waterfall; you'll have the option to cross on an old two-by-four (attached by a rope to keep it from washing away), however I preferred to just hop over the rock.  From there, you've reached the narrows.  You can rock hop a pretty good distance up the rocks, but sadly I was afraid I'd drop my phone and opted to leave it at a safer location towards the start of the bouldering.</p>

<p>Videos of the water here don't do it justice--you have to see it in person to appreciate just how powerful the flow is.  On the hike out, I met a white water kayaker who was hiking the trail the first time; he tried to name the obstacles for me (Go Left and Die is one that I remember, as well as Gorilla and Sunshine, though he named more), but I can't remember them all.</p>
