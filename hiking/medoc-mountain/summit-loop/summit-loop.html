	<h2>Medoc Mountain State Park - Summit Loop</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this hike on January 23rd, 2022 with my brother, my girlfriend, and her sister.  We hiked it after an impressive but shortlived snow, leaving the roads easily driveable but adding a pretty dusting of snow over the whole park.</p>

<p>The trail is a fairly easy 3-mile loop located just past the park's visitors center.  After crossing the Little Fishing Creek, we headed northwest, getting the steep part of the hike over first and went basically straight to the summit.</p>

<p>From there, we began a gradual descent which lasted most of the rest of the trail.  After a short while, we came across the Vinson Cemetery, a family graveyard with only 8 graves, all dated before the 1920s.  From there, we hiked the rest of the way back, spending much of the remainder walking alongside the Little Fishing Creek.</p>
