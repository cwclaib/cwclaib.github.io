	<h2>Grayson Highlands - Cabin Creek Trail</h2>
</center>

<p>This was a short, 2-mile hike along Cabin Creek in Grayson Highlands State Park near Mouth of Wilson, Virginia.  I hiked this trail with 4 friends on October 3rd, 2020.  The trail itself is fairly straightforward to hike and clearly marked.  It got a little steep in some sections, but was fun and easy to hike.  The cascades from Cabin Creek proved fun to boulder around on.</p>

<p>We also followed a small side trail at some point and stumbled upon an abandoned cabin up off in the woods.  Some old newspaper which was pasted along the walls and floors to help insulate the cabin dated its last inhabitance to the 1940s.  Unfortunately, I failed to take any pictures of the cabin and have no way to indicate how far along the trail the cabin was.</p>
