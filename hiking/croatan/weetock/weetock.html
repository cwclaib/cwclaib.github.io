	<h2>Weetock Trail - Croatan National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this hike on Sunday, March 13th, 2022 with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>This hike, located just off of NC 58, is one of a handful of major hiking trails in Croatan National Forest other than the Neusiok Trail.  Long the "little brother" of the two trails, it has recently been receiving the attention it deserves.  I was only able to hike about 3 miles of the trail due to time contraints, but the hike served as a nice break in nature and a great representation of eastern NC's pine forests.</p>
