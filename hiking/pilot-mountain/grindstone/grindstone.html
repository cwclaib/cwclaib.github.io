	<h2>Grindstone Trail - Pilot Mountain State Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail on January 31st, 2021 by myself.</p>

<p>I had driven a friend to Mt. Airy to pick up a new car; while there, we ate at the Mt. Airy location of Little Richards, and then split up for the day.  Since I had driven all the way there, I decided to check out Pilot Mountain, as it had been a long time since I'd been.  Unfortuntely, some snow the night before made access to the park difficult; I could only access the main parking area.  I hiked a bit on the snow-covered Grindstone Trail, but turned around after a bit of time, as I did not have any water or hiking boots.</p>
