	<h2>High Shoals Loop Trail - South Mountain State Park</h2>
</center>


<p>I hiked this trail on Friday, May 6th 2022 with my mom.  Unfortunately we did not complete the loop because of some incoming rain and fairly persistant tornato watches.</p>

<p>The High Shoals Loop Trail starts at the High Shoals Falls Parking Lot in South Mountain State Park.  The trail starts out very wide and gravel, but quickly becomes a narrower trail, and features a large number of steps and staircases.  At the split of the loop, we headed south first towards High Shoals Falls.</p>

<p>You come across some smaller falls or rapids along the way, not long before reaching the falls themselves.  High Shoals Falls also has a small pool which, were it not for the numerous signs posted warning against it, looks like it would be great for swimming.</p>

<p>Because of the incliment weather (which had, to this point, held off) we decided to turn back around for Big Bear Falls, which was just down the turn of the loop to the east.  Unfortunately, here it started to rain.  We started to turn around at first, but a break in the clouds encouraged us to turn around.</p>
