	<h2>Hidden Cove Trail - South Mountain State Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail with my family on October 24th, 2021 on the way back from our house in Waynesville.</p>

<p>This was a quick, 3-mile hike that wasn't too strenuous but was pretty peaceful.  The beginning has a nice access point to Jacob Fork tributary, while the rest offers some nice forest views and a slight summit of the eastern section of the park, but because of the tree cover and sun's position, I did not photograph it.</p>
