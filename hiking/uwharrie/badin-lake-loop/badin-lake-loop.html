	<h2>Badin Lake Loop Trail - Uwharrie National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked this trail the evening of Thursday, March 5th, 2022 with my mom.  Aside from a few people out fishing or paddling on the lake, we hardly ran into another soul.  This was probably because we started way to late in the day; for the second half of the hike, we were covered in a veil of darkness because the sun had set.</p>

<p>We started at the Cove Boat Ramp of Badin Lake.  The first bit of the trail was some pretty rough and slanted gravel, but after that it was pretty easily navigable and easy to follow.  Since the trail almost always follows the shore of the lake, there is no shortage of good lake views.</p>

<p>As the evening progressed, the sun got lower and lower.  Though not ideal for hiking, it was awfully pretty.</p>

<p>The attentive reader may have noticed that some of the photos went backwards; that's because they did.  Rather than hiking the entire loop, my mom and I decided to back-track and re-hike the first half twice.  It was about the same distance either way (maybe even a bit longer), but we thought it would be better to walk an area we'd already covered rather than untested pathways.</p>
