	<h2>Yates Place Campground - Uwharrie National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited Yates Place Campground January 28th-29th, 2022 with my girlfriend.  We had driven to Mt. Gilead to eat at the famous Lefler's Place, the oldest operating cafe in both Montgomery and Stanly Counties (open since 1922) and planned to hike the ruins of the former Montgomery County Seat of Lawrenceville, and found the Yates Place Campground as the perfect nearby public campsite.  After eating our 'cue, we rolled into camp at around 7 PM.</p>

<p>Though when we planned the trip there had been no chance for snow, as the weekend had gotten closer, the chances went up.  Shortly after we put out our small fire and retired to the temp, a meager drizzle came down; later that night, it turned to a full-fledged snow.  We got about 1-1.5" of snow at the campsite -- enough to partially collapse my cheap Ozark Trails tent!  Thankfully, my new 4WD 4Runner took the snow-covered dirt and gravel roads like a pro and we had no issues leaving the campground.</p>

<p>Though the campgrounds were along the Uwharrie Trail, we didn't actually hike any of it.  We walked along some of the main access road and took in the snowscape, but otherwise just decamped, ate breakfast, and headed to the next hike.</p>
