	<h2>Woodrun Trail - Uwharrie National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked the Woodrun Trail on January 29th, 2022 with my girlfriend.  The experience was made interesting because of a somewhat unexpected overnight snowfall which totaled about 2" in some areas.  It was her first time hiking in the snow, and my first real hike in the snow (other than a quick walk around Pilot Mountain in 2021).  We followed Woodrun Road (the gravel hunt camp access road) for the start of the hike, but took the foot trail on the way back.</p>
