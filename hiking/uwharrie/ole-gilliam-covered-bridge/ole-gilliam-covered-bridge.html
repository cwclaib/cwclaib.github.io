	<h2>Ole Gilliam Covered Bridge - Ole Gilliam Mill Park</h2>
</center>

<p>* Though not technically in the Uwharries, I have listed the covered bridge here because of its relative proximity as compared to any other major recration area.</p>

<p>I visited the Ole Gilliam Covered Bridge on Saturday, January 29th, 2022.  Unlike the Pisgah Covered Bridge, there is no hiking to be done in this area.</p>
