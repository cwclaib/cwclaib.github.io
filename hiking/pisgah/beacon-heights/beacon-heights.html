<p>Visited on Sunday, November 8th, 2020.</p>

<p>A short (1 mile) trail along the Blue Ridge Parkway (near Grandfather Mountain) located at mile marker 305.2.</p>

<p>This trail is easy to follow and well marked; though a bit steep, it should not be much of a challenge for most hikers.  The end of the hike has a large rock face which provides a great place to sit and relax.</p>
