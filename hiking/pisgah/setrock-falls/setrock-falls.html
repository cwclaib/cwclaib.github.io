	<h2>Setrock Falls - Pisgah National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this hike early in the morning on Saturday, June 25th, 2022, with my girlfriend.  We camped nearby and were able to start right around 7 AM; that meant we got the falls all to ourselves, though we did run into a few people as we left that were headed there.</p>

<p>We started the hike from the Black Mountain Campground parking area; first, we crossed a bridge over the South Toe River before heading into Briar Bottom Campground and then taking an immediate left towards the Mount Mitchell trailhead.</p>

<br>
<p>At just over a mile, the hike is very easy; the first half-to-3/4 of the hike follows the river at a gradually increasing elevation.</p>

<p>After some time, you cross S Toe River Rd; the trail immediately becomes slightly more rugged, but is still fairly navigable, in terms of hiking trails.  We saw some wildlife while hiking, including this lil snail.</p>

<p>After a short hike, you've reached the falls!</p>
