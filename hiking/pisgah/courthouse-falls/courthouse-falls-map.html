	<p>A map of Courthouse Falls Trail via FR 140 (white; marked by me with "140" but map calls it Court House Crk--note that 140 continues left at the intersection rather than right, as the map says, as right becomes FR 5031, which connects to Farlow Gap Trail) or via Summey Cove Trail (red).  Note that this map is a composite created from multiple maps and should be used only for reference.</p>
