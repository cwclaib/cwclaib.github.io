	<h2>Roadie River Rocks - Pisgah National Forest</h2>
</center>

<p>I went to this area on Saturday, July 4th with my brother, mom, dad, and our dog.  I have since visited there with several friends and never encountered anyone else there.</p>

<p>This scenic little swimming hole is just off the road on FSR 475.  To get there, take US 276 north, towards Waynesville; after 5.3 miles, take a left onto Forest Service Road 475 (Davidson River Road).  After 1.5 miles, you'll have to turn left to stay on FSR 475; drive another 1/2 a mile and you'll reach a major u-shape in the road with a small shoulder to park on.  Park on either side of the road and head towards the basin of the U (northward), and you should be able to easily find this hidden little cove.</p>

<p>A short dirt trail takes you to a small water feature with a nice rock to sit along, as you can see my dad and his dog doing here.  The water here is deceptively deep--at least 3-4 feet deep in some places.  It offers some nice swimming and is a cool place to just cool off.</p>

<p>If you keep following the trail past the rocks, you'll come upon a primitive camping area.  The trail goes further into the woods, but I didn't check to see where it led.</p>
