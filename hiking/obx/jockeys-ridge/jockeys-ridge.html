	<h2>Jockeys Ridge State Park</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this area on June 6th, 2021 with two friends.  One was from Switzerland and wanted to see more of the state.  While we were out there, we ate lunch at Pigman's BBQ in Nag's Head.  After watching NC State's baseball team take down Stanford 10-4, part of NC State's historic truncated run at the College World Series, at Mulligan's Grille, and dinner at Red Drum Tap House.</p>
