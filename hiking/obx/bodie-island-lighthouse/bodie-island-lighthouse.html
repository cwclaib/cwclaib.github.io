	<h2>Bode Island Lighthouse</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this area on June 6th, 2021 with two friends.  One was from Switzerland and wanted to see more of the state and its culture, so I took him to the Outer Banks after a lunch of NC-style barbecue at Pigman's BBQ in Nag's Head.  After watching NC State's baseball team take down Stanford 10-4 at Mulligan's Grille (part of NC State's historic but truncated run at the College World Series), we had dinner at the pub-styled Red Drum Tap House and then headed back to Raleigh.</p>
