	<h2>Zebulon Vance Birthplace</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this site on October 16th, 2021 with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>I organized a trip in October 2021 to drive the unpaved portion of NC-197.  While up there, I did a few hikes around the Blue Ridge Parkway (Rattlesnake Lodge, Craggy Gardens, and a very foggy Mount Mitchell, in addition to several scenic overlooks) and swung by former Governor Zebulon Vance's birthplace.  Unfortunately, we moved slower than expected thanks to a frequent pivoting of plans caused by the rain and fog.  We arrived just minutes before closing, but soon enough to speed-run the museum and the outdoor portions of the site as the buildings were getting shuttered.</p>
