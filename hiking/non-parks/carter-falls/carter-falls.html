<p>I explored this historic fort on September 6th, 2021 with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>A part of the Mountains to Sea trail, this is a fun and relatively easy 4 mile trail.  It starts at Grassy Creek Vineyard and Winery and heads southeastward.  The trail feels very informal but is fairly well-marked.  Early on, you cross Grassy Creek on a foot bridge.</p>

<p>After just under 3/4 of a mile, you cross Martin Byrn Rd and some tobacco fields.  We also came across a small little gnome hut someone nearby had made.  Later on, you pass through Byrd's Branch Campground and Store.  After 1.5 miles total, you cross Pleasant Ridge Rd and are nearly to the falls.</p>

<p>The trailhead to the falls, which has its own parking area, features a cute metal man to help guide your ways to the falls.

<p>After hiking back, we enjoyed a wine sampler and some live bluegrass music from Grassy Creek Winery.</p>
