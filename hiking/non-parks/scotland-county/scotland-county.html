	<h2>Scotland County Historic Sites</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited these sites on February 6th, 2022 while in Laurinburg.  Unfortunately, the Rural Heritage Museum itself was closed because of Covid, and the John Blue House for restoration work, but my brother and I decided to poke around the historic buildings on-site anyways, and did a walking phone tour which was enriching.</p>

<p>The Walthour-Moss land was interesting to walk around, as it's believed to be some of the most pristine and untouched forest land in eastern North Carolina, but I didn't take many pictures.  There were, however, scores of some of the largest pinecones I've ever seen scattered about the sandy forest floor.</p>
