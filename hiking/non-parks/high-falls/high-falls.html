	<h2>High Falls Dam</h2>

<p>I have visited this area several times, but the following pictures come from a trip on June 26th, 2020.</p>

<p>A small (former) dam on Deep River, NC, this weir offers a fun place to explore the river and test your balance by hopping along the rocks protruding from the water.  There's a large rock in the middle of the section which according to my friend is locally called Music Rock after a man became stuck on that rock during a flood; he sang while stuck there both to pass the time and to alert people to his presence.</p>

<p>The dam started as an old mill dam and was eventually converted to a hydroelectric dam.  The dam was purchased in 2018 to be renovated and repaired, but the work required proved to be too costly, especially after flooding from 2018's Hurricane Florence; now, it's listed as a Critical Habitat for the Cape Fear Shiner.  There are plans in progress for the dam to be removed.</p>
