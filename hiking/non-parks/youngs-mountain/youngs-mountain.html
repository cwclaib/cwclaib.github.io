	<h2>Youngs Mountain Trail</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this hike on May 5th, 2023 with my mom and brother.</p>

<p>This hike, which clocks in just over 4 miles round-trip, is a hike located within a gated community on private property owned by <a href="https://conservingcarolina.org/who-we-are/">Conserving Carolina</a>.  You must register with the group prior to the hike; they will send an email with gate code and parking instructions.  Speaking of parking, the spots are limited to two (or three if you get creative), so try and come at a time when you don't think the other 4 cars allowed in per day will be there.</p>

<p>This hike starts with a fairly gentle slope and crosses several small streams while you work your way through a forested area.  Be sure to look out for both the large boulders, of which there are many in the area, and also the wildlife: while I was here, we saw a snake, as well as several lizards, birds, bees, and more.</p>

<p>After about a half mile, the hike will start to feature a more aggressive incline and starts to feature some moderate cliff faces.  This terrain will be most of the remainder of the hike.</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll reach the top, where you're rewarded with a great panoramic view of Lake Lure and the surrounding forests.</p>
