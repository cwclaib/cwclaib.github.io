	<h2>Roanoke Rapids Canal Trail</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked a small portion of this trail on January 23rd, 2022 with my brother, my girlfriend, and her sister.  We only hiked about 1 mile roundtrip, from the museum (which was closed for the day) to the ruins of an old hydroelectric bulkhead.  We caught the start of a pretty sunset through the powerlines on the way back.  There was also an adorable snowman someone else had made waiting for us at the bench of the bulkhead overlook.</p>
