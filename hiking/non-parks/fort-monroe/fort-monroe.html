	<h2>Fort Monroe (Virginia)</h2>
</center>

<p>I explored this historic fort on June 22nd, 2019 by myself.</p>

<p>I started with a loop around the fort's upper pentagonal shape.  I didn't take any pictures of it, but this section had become an informal pet cemetary over the years, with dozens of old grave stones marking the resting place of loved pets.</p>

<p>Some interesting facts about the area:</p>

<p>Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederacy, was imprisoned in Fort Monroe for 2 years.  He was originally held in a small cell, but after 4-1/2 months he was allowed to occupy larger quarters.</p>

<p>The museum also had a section dedicated to the Fort Monroe Club, which was a mens' club opened in 1852.  In 1869, the Old Point Billiard Club was constructed to take some of the crowding from Carrol Hall, the building in which Davis was temporarily held which also doubled as a mess hall and a location for social gatherings, however, the Club burnt down during an 1870 Christmas party.  In 1871, the mess hall (Carrol Hall) and the reconstructed club were combined as the Fort Monroe Club.</p>

<p>From its opening in 1871 until World War I, the club was a male-only establishment.</p>

<p>Reportedly, there was also a "continuous poker game" from just after the Civil War until the First World War forced a break in the action.</p>

<p>A tradition of the club was to leave certain objects of personal value after staying there.  Items ranged from original artwork to weapons.</p>
