	<h2>Morrow Mountain State Park - Short Loop</h2>
</center>

<p>I did this hike on September 19th, 2020 with a group of several friends.  Unfortunately, we were forced back after fairly little hiking due to class commitments and a late start.  This loop was a quick and easy 3/4-mile loop.</p>

<p>Note that officially this trail is referred to as "Mountain Loop Trail" and should not be confused with "Bridle: Short Loop."</p>
