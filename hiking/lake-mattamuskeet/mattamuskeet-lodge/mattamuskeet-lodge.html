	<h2>Lake Mattamuskeet - Lake Mattamuskeet Lodge</h2>
</center>

<p>I visited this area on own on December 18th, 2022.</p>

<p>This condemned building at Lake Mattamuskeet has been many things.  When it first opened in the early 20th century, it was the world's largest pumphouse, built for the express purpose of draining the shallow lake to convert it into farmland.  After nearly a decade of failures, the pumphouse was converted into a hunting lodge; it operated in this capacity until the 1970s, when state hunting regulations forced its closure.  The structure of the building has been deteriorating for years, causing it to be unsafe to enter.</p>
