	<h2>Lake Mattamuskeet - Wilderness Loop</h2>
</center>

<p>I drove through this area on own on December 18th, 2022.</p>

<p>After catching the morning sunrise on Lake Mattamuskeet's Observation Deck, I turned back south down NC 94 and drove into the park proper, to take in some of the wildlife in the area.  I was not disappointed, being greeted by thousands of migratory waterfowl right along the entrance road.</p>

<p>After swinging by the visitor's center and the <a href="../mattamuskeet-lodge/mattamuskeet-lodge.html">Mattamuskeet Lodge</a>, I crossed the short bridge over the canal which Wildlife Drive follows, and drove down the gravel road a short ways.  Unfortunately, I was beset by a punctured tire, and decided to turn around to investigate and change it where I knew I would have space to.</p>
