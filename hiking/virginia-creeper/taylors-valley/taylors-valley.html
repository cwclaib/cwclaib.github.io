	<h2>Virginia Creeper Trail - MM 23 ~ 16 (Taylor's Valley)</h2>
</center>

<p>If you're biking the trail east to west, this is the next section of the trail you'll encounter.  This area also covers the Straight Branch area but I didn't take many pictures of that section.</p>

<p>I've done part of this section twice.  The first time (August 2nd, 2020) on foot hiking eastward with just my brother; we started that afternoon in Damascus and camped just outside of Taylor's Valley.  The second time (October 4th, 2020) I biked westward with some friends.</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure this batch of pictures is from roughly the Straight Branch area.</p>

<p>This grouping of pictures comes from the campsite my brother and I set up right before; it's just before Trestle 28 on the map below.  There was a campsite near where we were staying that you are supposed to reserve before use, but we also were technically on the bank of the South Holston River, just outside the site.  Also, we didn't see those signs, however, until the next morning as we were leaving -- oops!</p>

<p>Finally, these pictures are from the gravel section of the trail just across the bridge.  It's a very pastoral section of the trail which crosses by several small farms.</p>

<p>The following pictures come from the second time I biked the trail.  They are all of what I believe is Trestle 28, though it could be 29.</p>
