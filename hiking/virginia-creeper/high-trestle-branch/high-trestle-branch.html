	<h2>Virginia Creeper Trail - MM 34 ~ 27 (High Trestle Branch)</h2>
</center>

<p>If you're biking the trail, these are more than likely going to be the first few miles of trail you do, starting in the east near Whitetop Virginia and heading west, downhill.  You start at an old train depot and eventually cross High Trestle Branch, named after one of the highest and longest sections of bridge along the Virginia Creeper Trail.</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll pass the old Green Cove Station, which has a small park, and some time either before or after that you'll find a large rock which some friends and I climbed up on.  You'll also see several signs to visit Sarge's Pay Pond, where you can pay to feed some fish.</p>
