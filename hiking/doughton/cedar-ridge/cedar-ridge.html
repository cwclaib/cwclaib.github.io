	<h2>Cedar Ridge Trail - Doughton Recreation Area</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked part of this trail on Sunday, June 5th, 2022 with my girlfriend.  We didn't do all of it because my girlfriend wasn't feeling the best and because we got there a bit late in the day.</p>

<p>The trail was very isolated and remote: we only ran into two groups the entire time, and four total people.  While we didn't complete the hike, the section we did was full of beautiful nature scenes from one of the most pristine and rugged sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway.  While there weren't any majestic views or vistas, the serene and nearly-untouched nature of the trail was definitely worth the hike.</p>

<p>We started at the end on the Blue Ridge Parkway, near the Brinegar Cabin, where we finished the afternoon hike with a quick lesson about the edible plants and berries of the area, given by a very friendly park ranger.</p>

<p>The trail started out with a slight descent, but quickly became much steeper.  It was a bit deceptive: the hike back up felt <i>much</i> steeper than going down.</p>
