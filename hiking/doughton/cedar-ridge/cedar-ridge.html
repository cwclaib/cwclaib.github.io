	<h2>Cedar Ridge Trail - Doughton Recreation Area</h2>
</center>

<p>I hiked part of this trail on Sunday, June 5th, 2022 with my girlfriend.  We didn't do all of it because my girlfriend wasn't feeling the best and because we got there a bit late in the day.</p>

<p>The trail was very isolated and remote: we only ran into two groups the entire time, and four total people.  While we didn't complete the hike, we didn't come upon any any majestic views, but the serene and untouched nature of the trail was definitely worth the hike.  We started at the end on the Blue Ridge Parkway, near the Brinegar Cabin.</p>

<p>The trail started out with a slight decent, but quickly became much steeper.</p>
