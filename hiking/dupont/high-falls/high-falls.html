	<h2>High Falls - DuPont State Forest</h2>
</center>



<p>I have hiked this trail twice; the first time with my parents and brother on August 12th, 2018, and the second time on October 31st, 2020 with a group of friends.</p>

<p>The first time I did the hike, I started at the <a href="../hooker-falls/hooker-falls.html">Hooker Falls</a> parking lot, following riverside from the top of <a href="../triple-falls/triple-falls.html">Triple Falls</a>.  Eventually, you reach a small rock outcropping at the base of the falls which offers a great place for family photos, though you will get a bit wet.</p>

<p>Heading back towards the trail, you can take the western side of High Falls Loop; this hike affords you several nice vistas from far away that really allow you to appreciate the magnitude of the falls.</p>

<p>If you keep heading south up High Falls Trail, you can eventually turn left on Covered Bridge Trail.  This bridge is at the top of High Falls and shows the size and swiftness of Little River.</p>

<p>The second time I hiked the trail, I started from the intersection of Stanton Road and Buck Forest Road, near the DuPont State Recreational Forest Visitor Center, which was closed at the time due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Once there, we followed a short section of trail near the Visitor Center (I believe it was officially part of the High Falls Loops trail) for a little while until we hit a branch which shortly connected us to High Falls Trail and then Covered Bridge Trail.</p>

<p>The second time, we followed some drainage channels which connected to a now-unmaintained (but formerly official) trail; this trail involved a bit of maneuvering and climbing, but was a fun secondary way to get up close to the falls.  You'll notice that the tree growing defiantly in the middle of the falls looks a bit worse for wear since the last time I was there (though, to be fair, it was late Fall).</p>

<p>While down there, we noticed a nice rainbow forming from the water churning down the falls.</p>

<p>After spending some time down at the bottom of the falls, we hiked back to the trail and got a nice view of the falls from afar.  This time, since it was late in the Fall, you can notice that most of the trees have lost their foliage, though a few stubborn bushes along the fence were just starting to turn red.</p>
